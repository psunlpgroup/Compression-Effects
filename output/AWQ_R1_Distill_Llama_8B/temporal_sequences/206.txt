Alright, let's try to figure out when Jennifer could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, Jennifer woke up at 5am. That's a key starting point. So, she was up at 5am.

Next, Steven saw Jennifer stretching at a yoga studio from 5am to 8am. So, Steven saw her there during that time. That means Jennifer was at the yoga studio between 5am and 8am.

Then, Richard saw Jennifer waiting at the train station from 8am to 10am. So, right after Steven saw her at 8am, Richard saw her at the train station until 10am.

Mark saw Jennifer walking in the garden from 12pm to 7pm. So, that's later in the day, from 12pm to 7pm.

Now, the coffee shop was closed after 7pm. So, Jennifer couldn't have gone there after 7pm.

Putting this all together:

- Jennifer was at the yoga studio from 5am to 8am.
- Then, she was at the train station from 8am to 10am.
- After that, she was walking in the garden from 12pm to 7pm.
- The coffee shop was only open until 7pm.

So, when could she have gone to the coffee shop? She was at the garden from 12pm to 7pm, but the coffee shop was closed after 7pm. So, she must have gone to the coffee shop before 7pm while she was walking in the garden.

Looking at the options:

(A) 10am to 12pm: But she was at the train station until 10am and then started walking at 12pm. So, she wasn't free until 12pm.

(B) 5am to 8am: She was at the yoga studio during that time, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop then.

(C) 8am to 10am: She was at the train station during that time, so again, she couldn't have been at the coffee shop.

(D) 12pm to 7pm: This fits because she was walking in the garden during that time, and the coffee shop was open until 7pm.

So, the correct answer should be option (D), 12pm to 7pm.
