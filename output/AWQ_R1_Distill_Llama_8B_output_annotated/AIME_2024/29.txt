["initializing"] Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1 and ω^13 = 1. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] First, let me write down the product: Product = Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] I notice that each term in the product is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Maybe I can simplify this expression. Let me set x = ω^k. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². That's a quadratic in x. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me rearrange it: x² - 2x + 2 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic or find its roots. Let's compute the discriminant: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Discriminant D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] So the roots are complex: x = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Therefore, each term in the product is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), which is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So the product becomes: Product = Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Which can be written as: Product = [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))] ["end-section"]

["initializing"] So now, the problem reduces to evaluating two products: one with (1 + i) and the other with (1 - i). ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Now, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all roots of a polynomial can be related to the polynomial evaluated at a specific point. Specifically, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is equal to x^13 - 1, since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but in our case, we have products of (ω^k - a) and (ω^k - b). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So maybe I can relate this to evaluating the polynomial x^13 - 1 at x = a and x = b. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Indeed, yes. The product Π_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) is equal to the product over all roots of x^13 - 1 of (a - root), which is equal to (a^13 - 1). Similarly for b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, A = a^13 - 1, B = b^13 - 1 Hence, Product = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Given that ω is a primitive 13th root, so ω^13 = 1, and since ω ≠ 1, a and b are not equal to ω, but perhaps something else. Wait, no, a and b are complex numbers, not roots of unity necessarily. ["end-section"]

["clarification"] Wait, let me clarify. a and b are 1 + i and 1 - i, which are complex numbers, not roots of unity. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, when we compute a^13 and b^13, we need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, (1 + i) can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i13π/4}. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Similarly, (1 - i) is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i13π/4}. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Compute e^{i13π/4} and e^{-i13π/4}. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Since 13π/4 is equivalent to 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, e^{i13π/4} = (cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Similarly, e^{-i13π/4} = (cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4)). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i*(-sqrt(2)/2)) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i*(-sqrt(2)/2)) ["end-section"]

["clarification"] Wait, let me compute cos(5π/4) and sin(5π/4): ["end-section"]

["deduction"] cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, (1 + i)^13 = - (sqrt(2))^14 / 2 * (1 + i) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = - (sqrt(2))^14 / 2 * (1 - i) ["end-section"]

["verification"] Wait, hold on, let me verify: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Wait, actually, for each z, (z - a)(z - b) is a quadratic in z, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, Product = (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1) ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, another approach: Let me denote z = ω^k. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then each term in the product is 2 - 2z + z². ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] As before, this is equal to (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). ["end-section"]

["clarification"] Therefore, the product over z is equal to the product over (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But the product over all z of (z - a)(z - b) is equal to (a^13 - 1)(b^13 - 1), ["end-section"]

["verification"] Let me check my steps. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, the product over k=0 to 12 is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute each: ["end-section"]

["clarification"] But 13π/4 = 3π + π/4, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Compute 8321 divided by 1000: ["end-section"]

["verification"] So, 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the remainder is 321 when the product is divided by 1000. ["end-section"]

["final-answer"] Therefore, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\). ["end-section"]
