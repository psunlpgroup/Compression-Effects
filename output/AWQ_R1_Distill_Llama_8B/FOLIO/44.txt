Alright, let me try to work through this logic problem step by step. So, the premise is a bit complex with several statements, and I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain. Let's break it down.

First, the premises:

1. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
2. Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
3. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
4. All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
5. All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
6. If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
7. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

The conclusion is: Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.

Okay, let's start by identifying what each premise tells us.

From premise 3: All female players lost to Iga Świątek. So, any female player at RG2022 lost to Iga.

From premise 4: All players are either female or male. So, no non-female or non-male players.

From premise 5: All male players lost to Rafael Nadal. So, every male player at RG2022 lost to Nadal.

Now, premise 6: If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Nadal, then Coco is not a male player at RG2022.

But wait, premise 5 says all male players lost to Nadal. So, if Coco lost to Nadal, and if premise 6 applies, then Coco is not a male player. So, if Coco lost to Nadal, he must be female. But premise 3 says all female players lost to Iga. So, if Coco is female, she must have lost to Iga.

But premise 2: Everyone who lost to Iga is ranked highly by WTA. So, if Coco lost to Iga, she's ranked highly, making her one of the most active players.

But premise 1 is a conditional: If someone is ranked highly, then they are active. But it doesn't say only if they are ranked highly. So, if Coco is ranked highly, she is active. But if she's not ranked highly, premise 1 doesn't say anything about her activity.

Wait, but from premise 6, if Coco is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, she's not a male. If she's female, she must have lost to Iga, making her ranked highly, hence active.

But wait, premise 6 says if Coco is ranked highly OR lost to Nadal, she's not male. So, if she's male, she didn't lose to Nadal? But premise 5 says all male players lost to Nadal, so that's a contradiction. So, if she's male, she must have lost to Nadal, but premise 6 says if she lost to Nadal, she's not male. So, she can't be male. Therefore, she must be female.

Since she's female, she lost to Iga (from premise 3), making her ranked highly (premise 2), hence active (premise 1). So, she is active.

Now, the conclusion is: Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga and is active.

But from above, Coco lost to Iga (since she's female), so she's a player who lost to Iga. And she is active because she's ranked highly. Therefore, she is both. So, the conclusion would be false because she is both.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Premise 6: If Coco is ranked highly OR lost to Nadal, she's not male. Since all males lost to Nadal, if Coco is male, she lost to Nadal, making her not male, which is a contradiction. So, Coco can't be male, so she's female. As female, she lost to Iga, making her ranked highly, hence active.

So, she is both: she lost to Iga and is active. Therefore, the conclusion that she is not both is false.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied something. Let me see.

Wait, premise 6: If Coco is ranked highly OR lost to Nadal, then she's not male. So, if she's male, she didn't lose to Nadal? But premise 5 says all male players lost to Nadal, so if she's male, she must have lost to Nadal, which would make her not male, which is a contradiction. Therefore, she's not male, so she's female.

As female, she lost to Iga, so she's ranked highly, so she's active. Therefore, she is both: lost to Iga and active. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Yes, that seems right.

The conclusion is false because Coco Gauff is both a player who lost to Iga Świątek and one of the most active players in major tennis.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
