Alright, let's try to figure out when Sarah could have gone to the gas station. So, we have a bunch of information here, and I need to piece it together step by step.

First, Sarah woke up at 6am. That's our starting point. Then, we have three different people who saw Sarah at different places at different times:

1. **Samantha** saw Sarah reading at the library from 6am to 9am.
2. **Mary** saw Sarah taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 11am.
3. **Steven** saw Sarah buying cookies at a bakery from 11am to 2pm.

Finally, the gas station was closed after 9pm. So, Sarah must have gone to the gas station when the station was still open, which means before 9pm.

Let's list out the times when Sarah was seen by others:

- **Samantha**: 6am to 9am
- **Mary**: 9am to 11am
- **Steven**: 11am to 2pm

Now, we need to see if there's a time overlap where Sarah wasn't being seen by others, which would mean she was at the gas station.

Let's break it down:

- From 6am to 9am: Samantha saw her.
- From 9am to 11am: Mary saw her.
- From 11am to 2pm: Steven saw her.

So, between 2pm and 9pm, none of the above people saw her. That's a big window! But we also know the gas station was closed after 9pm, so Sarah could have gone anytime between 2pm and 9pm.

Wait, but the options don't include 2pm to 9pm. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options:
(A) 11am to 2pm
(B) 2pm to 9pm
(C) 9am to 11am
(D) 6am to 9am

Oh, option (B) is 2pm to 9pm. That matches the time when none of the others saw her. So, Sarah could have gone to the gas station between 2pm and 9pm.

But wait, the gas station was closed after 9pm. Does that mean it was closed by 9pm, so Sarah could have gone up until 9pm. So, the latest she could have gone is 9pm, but the option is 2pm to 9pm, which fits.

So, the correct answer is (B).

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Sarah was seen from 6am by Samantha until 9am, then Mary saw her from 9am to 11am, and Steven saw her from 11am to 2pm. So, the only time no one saw her is from 2pm to 9pm. That's when she could have gone to the gas station.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is (B).

The correct answer is (B) 2pm to 9pm.

Answer: (B)
