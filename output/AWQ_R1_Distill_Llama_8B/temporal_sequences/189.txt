Alright, let's try to figure out when Sarah could have gone to the clothing store. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, Sarah woke up at 5am. So her day starts at 5am. Then, Ashley saw her taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 5am to 11am. That means Sarah was taking photos from when she just woke up until 11am.

Next, Michael saw her walking in the garden from 11am to 12pm. So after the photos, she was in the garden from 11am to 12pm. That takes us up to 12pm.

Emily saw her buying cookies at a bakery from 12pm to 2pm. So after the garden visit, she went shopping for cookies from 12pm to 2pm.

Richard saw her buying a phone at the electronics store from 2pm to 3pm. So after the cookies, she went to buy a phone.

Now, the clothing store was closed after 7pm. That means Sarah couldn't have gone there after 7pm. She must have gone earlier in the day.

Looking at the times when Sarah was seen by others, she was busy from 5am to 3pm. Let's break it down:

- 5am to 11am: Taking photos
- 11am to 12pm: Walking in the garden
- 12pm to 2pm: Buying cookies
- 2pm to 3pm: Buying a phone

So, from 3pm onwards, she wasn't seen by anyone doing anything specific mentioned here. The clothing store was closed after 7pm, but she could have gone earlier.

If we consider the times she was occupied, she was likely too busy from 5am to 3pm. Therefore, the only time she wasn't seen by anyone mentioned is after 3pm up to 7pm.

So, the possible time she could have gone to the clothing store is between 3pm and 7pm.

Let me check the options:

(A) 3pm to 7pm – This fits with what I found.

(B) 2pm to 3pm – She was buying a phone during this time, so she wasn't free.

(C) 12pm to 2pm – She was buying cookies then.

(D) 11am to 12pm – She was walking in the garden.

So, option A is the correct time when Sarah could have gone to the clothing store.

The correct answer is (A) 3pm to 7pm.
