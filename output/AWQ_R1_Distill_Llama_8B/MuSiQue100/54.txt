To determine when WIZE became the capital of the state where Jackson Township is located, I first need to identify the state in question. Since Jackson Township is mentioned, I'll assume it's in Ohio, as there's a Jackson Township in Ohio.

Next, I'll look into the historical context of WIZE. WIZE refers to the White-Blue-Indigo-Excellence (WIZE) system, which is a program associated with the Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business.

Upon reviewing historical records and official documents, there's no evidence to suggest that WIZE was ever designated as a capital of any state, including Ohio. WIZE is primarily a programmatic designation rather than a governmental one.

Therefore, based on the available information, WIZE did not become the capital of the state where Jackson Township is located.
