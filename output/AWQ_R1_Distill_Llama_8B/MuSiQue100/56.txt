The question is asking which country had the Border Troops of the republic known for the literature of the country of citizenship of Ilona Richter, and to provide the final answer in as few words as possible.

First, I need to identify who Ilona Richter is. It seems she is a person of interest in this question, possibly a citizen of a specific country. The key part here is understanding the connection between the Border Troops of a republic and the literature of her country of citizenship.

Given the mention of "Border Troops of the republic," it makes me think of a specific group associated with a particular republic. For instance, the Border Troops are often associated with Eastern European countries, such as Poland or Ukraine, which have significant border guard forces.

The mention of "literature of the country of citizenship" suggests that Ilona Richter is a citizen of a country known for its literary contributions. Countries with rich literary traditions include Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and others.

Considering the connection between the Border Troops and the literature, it might be referring to Poland, as the Polish Border Troops are a known entity, and Poland has a rich literary history.

Therefore, the country in question is likely Poland.
