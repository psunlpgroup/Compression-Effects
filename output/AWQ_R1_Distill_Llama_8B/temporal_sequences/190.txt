Alright, so Michael went to the football field, and I need to figure out between what times that could have happened. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, Michael's day starts at 5am when he wakes up. Then, Kimberly sees Michael stretching at a yoga studio from 5am to 7am. So, Michael was at the yoga studio during that time.

Next, William sees Michael walking in the garden from 7am to 8am. So, after the yoga session, Michael went to the garden.

Then, Sarah saw Michael fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8am to 10am. So, Michael was at the electronic store during that time.

Nancy saw Michael waiting at the airport from 10am to 12pm. So, after fixing the computer, Michael went to the airport.

Samantha saw Michael working out at the gym from 1pm to 9pm. So, Michael was at the gym during that time.

It's also mentioned that the football field was closed after 9pm. So, Michael couldn't have gone to the football field after 9pm because it was closed.

Now, I need to find the time when Michael was at the football field. Let's look at the timeline:

- 5am to 7am: Yoga studio
- 7am to 8am: Garden
- 8am to 10am: Electronic store
- 10am to 12pm: Airport
- 1pm to 9pm: Gym

The football field was closed after 9pm, so Michael couldn't have gone to the football field after 9pm. Let's see when he was free.

Between 5am to 7am: Yoga
7am to 8am: Garden
8am to 10am: Electronic store
10am to 12pm: Airport
1pm to 9pm: Gym

From this, Michael was occupied from 5am to 9pm, except for the times when he was at the airport or gym. Wait, no, the times overlap.

Wait, let's list out all the time intervals:

- 5am-7am: Yoga
- 7am-8am: Garden
- 8am-10am: Electronic store
- 10am-12pm: Airport
- 1pm-9pm: Gym

So, the only time when Michael wasn't doing any of these activities is between 12pm-1pm. Because from 10am-12pm, he was at the airport, and from 1pm-9pm, he was at the gym.

So, the only free time Michael had was between 12pm-1pm.

Therefore, Michael could have gone to the football field between 12pm and 1pm.

Looking at the options, that's option (A) 12pm to 1pm.

The correct answer is (A) 12pm to 1pm.
