Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the premise says that Robert Lewandowski is a striker. Strikers are soccer players. So, from this, it logically follows that Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player. That seems straightforward.

Next, the premise mentions that Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen. The additional information given is that if a player leaves a team, they no longer play for that team. So, if he left Bayern Munchen, he's no longer part of that team.

Putting it all together: Robert Lewandowski is a striker, which makes him a soccer player. He left his team, Bayern Munchen, so he's no longer with them. But the conclusion is just stating that he is a soccer player, not about his current team status.

Wait, the conclusion is only about whether he's a soccer player, which is directly supported by the premise. The fact that he left his team doesn't affect whether he's a soccer player; it just means he's not with that team anymore. So, the conclusion is definitely true because the premise already identifies him as a striker, which is a type of soccer player.

I don't see any uncertainties here because all the information clearly connects to the conclusion without any contradictions or missing information.
</think>

The conclusion is **true**. 

**Explanation:**
1. Robert Lewandowski is identified as a striker, which is a subset of soccer players.
2. Leaving a team (Bayern Munchen) does not negate his status as a soccer player.
3. The premise fully supports the conclusion without contradictions.

**Answer:** True
