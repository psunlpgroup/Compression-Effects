Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian." is true or not based on the given premise. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the premise. It says that Ailton Silva was born in 1995 and is commonly known as Ailton. He's a football player who was loaned out to Braga. Additionally, Ailton Silva is described as a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico. So, from this, I gather that Ailton is a Brazilian and plays for Náutico.

Now, the premise also mentions that Náutico is a football club, along with Braga, and that Fluminense is another football club. So, we have two clubs: Braga and Náutico, both being football clubs, and Fluminense is another one.

The conclusion claims that no one playing for Náutico is Brazilian. Wait, but from the premise, Ailton Silva is a Brazilian playing for Náutico. So, that directly contradicts the conclusion. The premise clearly states that Ailton is a Brazilian playing for Náutico. Therefore, the conclusion that "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian" must be false because Ailton is a Brazilian playing for Náutico.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other information that might affect this conclusion. The premise doesn't mention any other players for Náutico, only Ailton. So, based solely on the given information, Ailton is a Brazilian playing for Náutico, making the conclusion incorrect.

The conclusion is false because the premise explicitly states that Ailton Silva, a Brazilian, plays for Náutico. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that no one playing for Náutico is Brazilian.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
