Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the clothing store. I'll go through the information step by step.

First, David wakes up at 5am. That's his starting point.

Next, William saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 5am to 6am. So, David was at the electronics store during that time.

Then, David saw David buying a bike at the bike shop from 6am to 9am. So, he was at the bike shop during those hours.

After that, John saw David waiting at the train station from 9am to 10am. So, he was at the train station during that time.

The clothing store was closed after 3pm. That means the latest David could have gone there is before 3pm.

Now, let's piece this together:

- **5am to 6am**: At the electronics store.
- **6am to 9am**: At the bike shop.
- **9am to 10am**: At the train station.

So, after 10am, the next possible time he could have gone is between 10am and 3pm. That's the only window left before the clothing store closes.

Looking at the options, that's option (D): 10am to 3pm.

I think that's the correct time David could have gone to the clothing store.
