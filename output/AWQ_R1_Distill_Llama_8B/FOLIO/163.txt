Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the premise says that some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV. I know that The Bachelor gives out roses, so that means The Bachelor is one of those shows. The Bachelor is a reality TV show because it's about real people's lives. Now, the conclusion is that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm. Hmm, but Breaking Bad isn't a reality TV show. In fact, it's a drama. So, if Breaking Bad isn't a reality TV show, then it's not the same as The Bachelor. Since The Bachelor is the one that gives out roses on Monday at 8 pm, Breaking Bad doesn't fit that description. Therefore, the conclusion that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm is false.
