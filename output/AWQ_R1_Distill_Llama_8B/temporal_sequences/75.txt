Okay, so I need to figure out between what times Anthony could have gone to the bakery. Let's see, I'll start by listing out all the information given and then try to piece it together step by step.

First, Anthony woke up at 6am. That's a good starting point. Then, John saw Anthony working out at the gym from 6am to 10am. So, from 6am to 10am, Anthony was at the gym. That means he was not at the bakery during that time.

Next, Jennifer saw Anthony walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 10am to 12pm. So, from 10am to 12pm, Anthony was walking towards the Statue of Liberty. He was not at the bakery during this period either.

Then, Sarah saw Anthony buying lunch at the deli from 12pm to 1pm. So, from 12pm to 1pm, Anthony was buying lunch. That means he wasn't at the bakery during that time.

After that, Andrew saw Anthony buying a bike at the bike shop from 3pm to 5pm. So, from 3pm to 5pm, Anthony was buying a bike. The bakery was closed after 5pm, which probably means it was only open during certain hours before 5pm.

Now, let's try to find the possible times when Anthony wasn't doing any of these activities. He was at the gym from 6am to 10am, then walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 10am to 12pm, buying lunch from 12pm to 1pm, and buying a bike from 3pm to 5pm. So, the times when he wasn't doing those things could be the times when he went to the bakery.

Let's list the times:

- 6am to 10am: Gym
- 10am to 12pm: Statue of Liberty
- 12pm to 1pm: Lunch
- 3pm to 5pm: Bike shop

So, between 1pm to 3pm, that's a gap. Because after 1pm, the next activity starts at 3pm. So, from 1pm to 3pm, Anthony wasn't at the gym, Statue of Liberty, buying lunch, or buying a bike. That could be the time he went to the bakery.

Let's also check if there are any other possible times. After 5pm, the bakery was closed, so he couldn't have gone then. Between 1pm and 3pm, that's the only time when he wasn't doing any of the other activities mentioned.

Looking at the options provided:

(A) 1pm to 3pm
(B) 10am to 12pm
(C) 12pm to 1pm
(D) 3pm to 5pm

So, the correct answer should be (A) 1pm to 3pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (A) 1pm to 3pm.
