["initializing"] Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B given in the coordinate plane. ["end-section"]
["adding-knowledge"] O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). ["end-section"]
["adding-knowledge"] So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, but not as high as (0,1); instead, it's at sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, point B is above point A in the first quadrant. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, there's this family of segments, called F, which are segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, each segment PQ in F starts somewhere on the x-axis, say at (p, 0), and ends at some point on the y-axis, say (0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, which means p^2 + q^2 = 1. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. ["end-section"]
["adding-knowledge"] So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0, tracing out the unit circle in the first quadrant. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Now, the problem states that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. ["end-section"]
["uncertainty-estimation"] So, AB is a specific segment from F? ["end-section"]
["deduction"] Let me check: points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). ["end-section"]
["adding-knowledge"] So, the distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, AB is indeed a segment in F, since its length is 1. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, AB is one of the segments in F. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, the family F includes AB, but also includes all other unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, we need to find a point C on AB (not equal to A or B) that is not on any other segment from F. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, C is on AB, and no other segment PQ in F passes through C. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] So, we need to find such a point C, and compute OC^2, which is the square of its distance from the origin, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q. ["end-section"]
["backtracking"] Alright, let me think about how to approach this. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] First, let's parametrize segment AB. ["end-section"]
["adding-knowledge"] Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write parametric equations for AB. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] Let's let t vary from 0 to 1. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] So, for t in [0,1], the coordinates of a point C on AB can be written as: ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Now, we need to find t such that the point C is not on any other segment PQ in F. ["end-section"]
["deduction"] So, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, the equation of the line PQ must not pass through C, except for the case when PQ is AB itself. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] But since C is on AB, and AB is a segment in F, we need to find C such that for all other PQ in F, PQ does not pass through C. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Alternatively, point C is on AB, but it's not on any other PQ in F. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] So, perhaps we can consider the equation of line PQ for any p and q, and find the conditions on C so that it doesn't satisfy that equation for any p and q except when PQ is AB. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But let me denote t = p. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] But this is getting too complicated. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, but actually, for each t, this equation could have a solution p, but we want that for our specific t, there is no p in (0,1) that satisfies the equation, except for the case when p=1/2, which is the case of AB. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the equation sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q must have no solution for p in (0,1) except when p=1/2. ["end-section"]
