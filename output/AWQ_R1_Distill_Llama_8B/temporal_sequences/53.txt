Alright, let's try to figure out when Thomas could have gone to the physics classroom. I'll start by listing out all the information given.

First, Thomas woke up at 6am. That's his starting point.

Then, Mary saw Thomas playing tennis at the tennis court from 12pm to 1pm. So, at some point between 12 and 1pm, Thomas was playing tennis.

Next, Linda saw Thomas sitting on a rooftop from 1pm to 3pm. So, Thomas was on the rooftop during that time.

Then, Jason saw Thomas working out at the gym from 3pm to 7pm. So, he was at the gym between 3pm and 7pm.

After that, Michael saw Thomas buying a bike at the bike shop from 7pm to 10pm. So, he was buying a bike during that time.

Also, it's mentioned that the physics classroom was closed after 10pm. That means the latest Thomas could have gone to the classroom is by 10pm.

Now, let's try to piece this together.

Thomas wakes up at 6am. From 12pm to 1pm, he's playing tennis. So, he must have left his house sometime after 6am and was out until at least 1pm.

Then, from 1pm to 3pm, he's on the rooftop. So, he's still out until 3pm.

From 3pm to 7pm, he's at the gym. So, he's occupied until 7pm.

From 7pm to 10pm, he's buying a bike. So, he's out until 10pm.

The physics classroom is closed after 10pm, so Thomas could have gone to the classroom only before 10pm.

Looking at the times when Thomas is not occupied:

- From 6am to 12pm: He's presumably at home or free.
- From 7pm to 10pm: He's buying a bike.

Wait, but the question is asking when he could have gone to the physics classroom. So, we need to find a time when he wasn't occupied and the classroom was open.

Since the classroom is closed after 10pm, the latest he could have gone is by 10pm.

Looking at the free times:

- From 6am to 12pm: He's free, but during this time, Mary saw him playing tennis. So, he wasn't free the whole time.

Wait, no. Mary saw him at 12pm to 1pm, so he was occupied during that time.

So, before 12pm, he was free, but after that, he's occupied until 10pm.

So, the only free time after waking up at 6am is:

- From 6am to 12pm: He's free, but he's occupied during 12pm to 1pm.

Wait, but he was playing tennis from 12pm to 1pm, so he was occupied then.

So, the time he was free but not occupied is:

- From 6am to 12pm: He was free, but he was playing tennis from 12pm to 1pm.

So, he must have left his house after 6am and was out until at least 1pm.

So, the time he could have gone to the classroom is between when he was free and before he was occupied again.

But let's see:

He was at home from 6am to 12pm. During that time, Mary saw him playing tennis from 12pm to 1pm. So, he was free until 12pm, then occupied until 1pm.

So, the latest he could have gone to the classroom is before 12pm, but the earliest is after he woke up at 6am.

But wait, the classroom is closed after 10pm, so he could have gone at any time before 10pm, as long as he wasn't occupied.

So, the possible times he could have gone to the classroom are:

- 6am to 12pm: He was free, but during this time, he was playing tennis from 12pm to 1pm.

So, he was free from 6am to 12pm, then occupied from 12pm to 1pm.

So, he could have gone to the classroom anytime between 6am to 12pm, but after 12pm, he's occupied again.

Wait, but he's occupied from 12pm to 1pm, so he can't have gone during that time.

Therefore, the only time he could have gone is before 12pm.

But the options given are:

(A) 6am to 12pm

(B) 12pm to 1pm

(C) 3pm to 7pm

(D) 7pm to 10pm

So, the correct answer should be (A) 6am to 12pm.

But wait, let me double-check.

He wakes up at 6am. He's free until 12pm, when he starts playing tennis until 1pm.

So, he can go to the classroom anytime between 6am and 12pm.

So, the answer is (A).
</think>

The correct answer is (A) 6am to 12pm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Thomas wakes up at 6am.

2. He is free until 12pm, when he starts playing tennis.

3. The physics classroom is open until 10pm.

4. Therefore, the earliest he could have gone is between 6am and 12pm.

Answer: (A) 6am to 12pm
