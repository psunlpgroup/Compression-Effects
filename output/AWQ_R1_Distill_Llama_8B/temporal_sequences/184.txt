Okay, let's try to figure out when Sarah could have gone to the gas station based on the timeline provided. 

First, let's list out all the information given:

1. **Sarah woke up at 7am.**
2. **Kimberly saw Sarah sitting on a rooftop from 7am to 9am.**
3. **Mark saw Sarah buying a bike at the bike shop from 11am to 2pm.**
4. **John saw Sarah buying cookies at a bakery from 2pm to 3pm.**
5. **William saw Sarah fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 4pm.**
6. **The gas station was closed after 4pm.**

So, we need to find the time window when Sarah could have gone to the gas station. Let's break it down step by step.

- **7am to 9am:** Sarah was on the rooftop. So, she wasn't at the gas station during this time.
  
- **9am to 11am:** There's no information about Sarah during this period. So, it's possible she went to the gas station.

- **11am to 2pm:** Mark saw her buying a bike. So, she was definitely busy buying a bike during this time. She wouldn't have gone to the gas station.

- **2pm to 3pm:** John saw her buying cookies. Again, she was occupied, so she couldn't have gone to the gas station.

- **3pm to 4pm:** William saw her fixing the computer. She was busy during this time as well, so no gas station visit.

- **After 4pm:** The gas station was closed, so she couldn't have gone after 4pm.

Putting this all together, the only time Sarah wasn't seen by anyone and could have potentially gone to the gas station is between **9am to 11am**.

Now, let's match this with the options provided:

- **(A) 11am to 2pm:** She was buying a bike, so not possible.
- **(B) 2pm to 3pm:** She was buying cookies, so not possible.
- **(C) 9am to 11am:** This matches our calculation.
- **(D) 3pm to 4pm:** She was fixing the computer, so not possible.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(C)**.

The correct answer is **(C) 9am to 11am**.
