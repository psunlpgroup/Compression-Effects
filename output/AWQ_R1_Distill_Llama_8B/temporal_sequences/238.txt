Alright, so I need to figure out between what times Susan could have gone to the bakery. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, Susan woke up at 7am. That's her starting point.

Next, Samantha saw Susan buying clothes at the mall from 7am to 9am. So, Susan was at the mall during that time.

Then, Sarah saw Susan buying lunch at the deli from 12pm to 2pm. So, Susan was at the deli during this period.

After that, Thomas saw Susan watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 9pm. So, she was at the theater during this time.

James saw Susan attending class at the school from 9pm to 10pm. So, she was at school during this time.

It's also mentioned that the bakery was closed after 10pm. So, Susan couldn't have gone to the bakery after 10pm.

Now, let's see when Susan was free. She was at the mall from 7am to 9am, then at the deli from 12pm to 2pm, then at the theater from 2pm to 9pm, and finally at school from 9pm to 10pm.

Looking at these times, the periods when Susan wasn't occupied are:

- Between 9am to 12pm: She was at the mall until 9am and then at the deli from 12pm. So, from 9am to 12pm, she might have been free.

- Between 2pm to 9pm: She was at the theater during this time, so she couldn't have gone to the bakery.

- Between 10pm onwards: The bakery was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone then either.

So, the possible times she could have gone to the bakery are between 9am to 12pm.

Wait, but let me double-check. Between 9am to 12pm, she was at the mall until 9am and then at the deli from 12pm. So, she might have been free from 9am to 12pm.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 9am to 12pm, which is option (A).

The possible times Susan could have gone to the bakery are between 9am to 12pm.

**Answer:** (A) 9am to 12pm
