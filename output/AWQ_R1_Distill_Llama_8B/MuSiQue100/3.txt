Alright, so I need to figure out the name of the castle in the city where the performer of "Sleep is the Enemy" was formed. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably identify who the performer of "Sleep is the Enemy" is. I think it's a song, so I'm going to assume it's by a musical artist or a band. I recall that "Sleep is the Enemy" was released by a band called **The xx**. Okay, so the band is The xx.

Now, the question is about the city where The xx were formed. I'm not entirely sure, but I think The xx is associated with the UK, maybe London? I've heard that many British bands come from London. Let me think about other bands from London; there's The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and more recently, bands like Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead. So, it's plausible that The xx is from London.

Next, the question mentions a castle in the city where The xx was formed. If the city is London, I need to recall if there's a notable castle there. I know that London has several historic sites, but when I think of castles, one that comes to mind is the Tower of London. It's a famous landmark, a castle, and it's in central London. So, the castle would likely be the Tower of London.

Putting it all together: The xx is the band, formed in London, and the castle in London is the Tower of London. Therefore, the answer should be the Tower of London.
