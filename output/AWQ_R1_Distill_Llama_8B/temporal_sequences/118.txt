Leslie's timeline shows that she was seen by different people at various times:

1. **Thomas saw Leslie** from 7am to 9am.
2. **Nancy saw Leslie** buying a bike from 9am to 3pm.
3. **Ashley saw Leslie** driving to the water park from 3pm to 4pm.

Since the movies closed after 4pm, Leslie must have gone to the movies before 4pm. The latest time she was seen by Ashley was at 4pm, so she likely went to the movies before Ashley saw her.

**Possible time for movies:** Before 3pm, but after she was seen by Thomas and before Nancy saw her buying a bike.

**Options:**
- **(A) 3pm to 4pm**: Not possible because Ashley saw her at 3pm to 4pm, and the movies closed after 4pm.
- **(B) 7am to 9am**: Thomas saw her, but she was buying a bike later.
- **(C) 9am to 3pm**: Nancy saw her buying a bike during this time.
- **(D) 6am to 7am**: Leslie was awake but not seen by anyone.

The correct time Leslie could have gone to the movies is **7am to 9am**.

**Solution:**

Let's analyze the timeline step by step:

1. **Leslie's schedule:**
   - **Woke up at 6am.**
   - **Seen by Thomas** from **7am to 9am**.
   - **Seen by Nancy** buying a bike from **9am to 3pm**.
   - **Seen by Ashley** driving to the water park from **3pm to 4pm**.
   - **Movies closed after 4pm**.

2. **Determine the possible time for the movies:**
   - The movies closed at 4pm, so Leslie must have gone to the movies before 4pm.
   - The latest time she was seen by Ashley was at 4pm.
   - Therefore, she likely went to the movies before Ashley saw her at 3pm to 4pm.

3. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **(A) 3pm to 4pm**: Not possible because Ashley saw her at this time, and the movies closed after 4pm.
   - **(B) 7am to 9am**: Thomas saw her, but she was buying a bike later.
   - **(C) 9am to 3pm**: Nancy saw her buying a bike during this time.
   - **(D) 6am to 7am**: Leslie was awake but not seen by anyone.

**Correct Answer:** (B) **7am to 9am**

The correct time Leslie could have gone to the movies is **7am to 9am**.
