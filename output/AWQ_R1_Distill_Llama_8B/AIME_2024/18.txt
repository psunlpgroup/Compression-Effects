Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: In triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It's given that segment IA is perpendicular to segment OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that's an interesting condition. I need to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. Let me sketch triangle ABC, mark O and I. IA is perpendicular to OI, so angle AIO is 90 degrees.

Hmm, since O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter, there might be some known relations between them. I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be calculated using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Plugging in the given values, OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is √13. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. The formula is actually OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check that again. Yes, I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. So substituting, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is √13, which matches what I had before. Okay, that seems right.

Now, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, IA is the altitude from I to OI. Hmm, so maybe we can use some Pythagorean theorem here.

Let me denote the lengths: IA is the length from incenter to vertex A, which is something, but maybe I can relate it to the sides of the triangle. Wait, inradius is 6, which is the radius of the incircle, but IA is the distance from A to the inradius. Hmm, IA is not the inradius; it's the distance from vertex A to the incenter I.

Wait, so IA is the length of the segment from A to I, which is different from the inradius. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius.

Wait, actually, I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is:

IA = \sqrt{r^2 + \left( \frac{a + b - c}{2} \right)^2 }

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's better to use trigonometric relations.

In triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we can apply Pythagoras:

IA² + OI² = AO²

We know OI is √13, so IA² + 13 = AO².

But AO is the distance from A to the circumradius center O. Since O is the circumcenter, AO is just the circumradius, which is 13. So AO = 13.

So plugging into the equation:

IA² + 13 = 13²

So IA² = 13² - 13 = 169 - 13 = 156

Therefore, IA = √156. Simplify √156: 156 = 4*39, so √156 = 2√39.

Okay, so IA is 2√39.

Now, since I is the incenter, it is equidistant from all sides, and the distance is the inradius, which is 6. So, perhaps I can find the lengths of the angle bisectors or something else.

But I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote AB as c and AC as b, so I need to find b*c.

Hmm, in a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to the area or the semiperimeter.

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter. The formula is:

Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.

But that gives the area, but I need the product of two sides.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the formula for the distance from the inradius to a vertex. I think there is a formula for IA in terms of the angles of the triangle.

Yes, IA can be expressed as:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}.

Yes, that seems familiar. So, since we have IA = 2√39, and r = 6, then:

2√39 = \frac{6}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

So, \sin \frac{A}{2} = \frac{6}{2√39} = \frac{3}{√39} = \frac{3√39}{39} = \frac{√39}{13}

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13

Hmm, so A/2 = arcsin(√39 / 13)

Let me compute what angle A is. Let me compute sin(A/2):

√39 ≈ 6.245, so √39 /13 ≈ 0.4803

So, arcsin(0.4803) ≈ 28.7 degrees. Therefore, angle A is ≈ 57.4 degrees.

But I don't know if this is useful. Maybe I can relate angle A to the sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the product of two sides in a triangle.

Wait, in a triangle, the product of two sides can be expressed as:

b * c = (s - a) * (s - b) + something? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, actually, in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle.

That is, for sides b and c, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But we also have Area = r * s.

So, equate the two:

(1/2)*b*c*sin A = r * s

So, b*c = (2*r*s)/sin A

Hmm, so if I can find sin A, then I can compute b*c.

We have angle A, approximately 57.4 degrees, so sin A is approximately 0.841. But I need an exact value.

Wait, earlier we had sin(A/2) = √39 /13. So, using the double-angle formula, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)

So, sin A = 2*(√39 /13) * cos(A/2)

But I need cos(A/2). Since sin(A/2) = √39 /13, then cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin²(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = √130 /13.

Therefore, sin A = 2*(√39 /13)*(√130 /13) = 2*(√(39*130))/13

Compute 39*130: 39*130 = (40 -1)*130 = 5200 -130 = 5070

Wait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 3900+1170=5070.

So sin A = 2*√5070 /13

Simplify √5070: 5070 = 507 *10 = (3*13^2)*10, since 507 ÷13=39, which is 3*13.

So √5070 = √(3*13²*10) =13√30.

Therefore, sin A = 2*(13√30)/13 = 2√30.

Wait, that's nice. So sin A = 2√30.

Wait, but sin A can't be greater than 1. 2√30 is approximately 2*5.477 ≈10.954, which is way more than 1. So that can't be.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's backtrack.

We had sin(A/2) = √39 /13 ≈0.4803

Then cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (√39 /13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = √130 /13 ≈ 0.7692

So sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(√39 /13)*(√130 /13) = 2*(√(39*130))/13

Wait, 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so 3900+1170=5070, as before.

So sin A = 2*√5070 /13

But √5070: 5070 factors: 5070 = 507*10= (3*13^2)*10, as above.

So √5070=13√30

Therefore, sin A = 2*13√30 /13 = 2√30 ≈10.954, which is impossible because sine can't exceed 1.

Hmm, this is a problem. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the formula for IA is not IA = r / sin(A/2). Maybe that's incorrect.

Let me verify that formula. The distance from the incenter to a vertex.

I think the correct formula is IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}, but maybe I need to verify.

Wait, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have:

IA² + OI² = AO²

We have OI² =13, AO=13, so IA²=13² -13=156, IA=√156=2√39.

But if IA is 2√39, and IA is also supposed to be r / sin(A/2), which is 6 / sin(A/2), then:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6/(2√39)=3/√39=√39/13≈0.4803, which is what I had before.

But then sin A comes out to be 2√30, which is impossible.

So, perhaps my formula for IA is incorrect.

Wait, let me look up the correct formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.

Upon checking, the correct formula is:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Wait, but that can't be, because if IA = r / sin(A/2), and with r=6, sin(A/2)=√39/13≈0.4803, so IA≈6 /0.4803≈12.48, which is roughly √156≈12.49. So that seems correct.

Wait, so the formula is correct, but then sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39/13)*(√130/13)=2*(√5070)/13=2*13√30/13=2√30≈10.954, which is impossible.

So, contradiction. Therefore, my mistake must be somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of sin A is wrong.

Wait, angle A is the angle at vertex A, so in the triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If angle A is about 57 degrees, the other angles would be around 61.5 each, which is possible.

But sin A cannot be greater than 1. So, my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Given that in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees, so:

IA² + OI² = AO²

We have:

IA² + (√13)² = 13²

So, IA² +13=169

Therefore, IA²=156, IA=√156=2√39.

So, that part is correct.

Then, IA is also equal to r / sin(A/2). So:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2)=6/(2√39)=3/√39=√39/13≈0.4803

So, A/2≈28.7 degrees, so angle A≈57.4 degrees.

But then, sin A= sin(57.4 degrees)≈0.841, which is approximately 2√30≈10.954, but that is impossible.

Wait, so perhaps the formula for IA is different.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula for the distance from incenter to vertex.

Let me double-check.

In triangle AIO, right-angled at I, we have:

IA² + OI² = AO²

So, IA² +13=169

IA²=156, IA=√156=2√39.

So, that's correct.

But if IA is also equal to something else, perhaps using the formula for the inradius.

Wait, another formula for the distance from incenter to vertex A is:

IA = \frac{2Rr}{b + c - a}

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to refer to some standard formula.

Wait, perhaps in terms of angles.

Wait, in any case, if I have IA=2√39, and I also have IA=6 / sin(A/2), then:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2)=6/(2√39)=3/√39=√39/13≈0.4803

So, A/2≈28.7 degrees, so A≈57.4 degrees.

So, sin A≈0.841.

But then, from the formula, sin A=2√30≈10.954, which is impossible.

So, contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula IA = r / sin(A/2) is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}, where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A.

Wait, let's check that.

In triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have:

IA² + OI² = AO²

Which gives IA²=156.

Alternatively, in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, with legs IA and OI, hypotenuse AO.

Alternatively, another formula for IA is:

IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}

Wait, let's compute s - a.

Let me denote the sides: Let BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

Semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2.

So, if IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2), then:

IA² = r² + (s - a)^2

But we also have IA²=156, and r=6.

So, 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2

Therefore, (s - a)^2=120

So, s - a= sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30)

Hmm, that's interesting.

But s - a= ( -a + b + c)/2= (b + c -a)/2=2√30

So, (b + c -a)/2=2√30, so b + c -a=4√30.

Hmm, so that's one equation.

But I need another equation to relate a, b, c.

Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines.

In triangle ABC, a=2R sin A, so a=26 sin A.

Similarly, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

Also, angle A + angle B + angle C=180 degrees.

But I don't know angles B and C.

Alternatively, using the formula for area.

Area = r*s=6s.

Also, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 12s = b*c*sin A.

But we need to find b*c.

So, if I can express sin A in terms of s, maybe.

But I also have from earlier:

sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39 /13)*(√130 /13)=2√5070 /13=2*13√30 /13=2√30.

But sin A=2√30≈10.954, which is impossible.

Wait, so perhaps my mistake is that I assumed IA= r / sin(A/2). But in reality, IA is sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So, in that case, IA²=36 + (s -a)^2=156, so (s - a)^2=120, so s -a=2√30.

So, from that, I have:

s -a=2√30.

But s= (a + b + c)/2.

So, (a + b + c)/2 -a=2√30.

Therefore, (-a + b + c)/2=2√30.

Thus, -a + b + c=4√30.

So, b + c -a=4√30.

Which is similar to what I had earlier.

So, that's one equation.

Now, in triangle ABC, by the Law of Cosines:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

But I don't know a, b, c, or A.

But I can express a=26 sin A, as above.

So, a=26 sin A.

Similarly, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

But since A + B + C=180, we can write B + C=180 - A.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the formula for the semiperimeter.

s= (a + b + c)/2.

We have s -a=2√30.

Thus, s= a + 2√30.

So, s= a + 2√30.

Also, s= (a + b + c)/2.

Therefore, a + 2√30= (a + b + c)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

2a + 4√30= a + b + c

Therefore, a + b + c=2a +4√30.

Thus, b + c= a +4√30.

Which is consistent with the earlier equation: b + c -a=4√30.

So, that's consistent.

So, now, we have:

From Law of Sines:

a=26 sin A

b=26 sin B

c=26 sin C

Also, A + B + C=180.

We need another relation.

From the area formula:

Area= r*s=6s=6(a + b + c)/2=3(a + b + c).

Also, Area= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 3(a + b + c)= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But I also have b + c= a +4√30.

So, plug that in:

3(a + a +4√30)= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 3(2a +4√30)= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

Thus, 6a +12√30= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But b*c=26 sin B *26 sin C=26² sin B sin C.

So, 6a +12√30= (1/2)*26² sin B sin C * sin A.

But sin A= sin(180 - B - C)=sin(B + C).

So, sin A= sin(B + C).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe express sin B sin C in terms of angles.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of sum and product.

Wait, perhaps use the formula:

sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] /2

But cos(B + C)=cos(180 - A)= -cos A.

So, sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2

So, then:

6a +12√30= (1/2)*26² * [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2 * sin A

Wait, getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps express cos(B - C) in terms of other variables.

But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe think about the formula for product of sides in terms of the semiperimeter and angles.

Wait, another approach: since I know s -a=2√30, and s= a +2√30, then:

s= a +2√30

Also, s= (a + b + c)/2

So, a +2√30= (a + b + c)/2

So, 2a +4√30= a + b + c

So, b + c= a +4√30

So, as before.

Now, let me consider that in triangle ABC, the sides are related by the Law of Cosines:

a²= b² + c² - 2bc cos A

But a=26 sin A, so:

(26 sin A)^2= b² + c² - 2bc cos A

So, 676 sin² A= b² + c² - 2bc cos A

But b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, substitute:

676 sin² A= (26 sin B)^2 + (26 sin C)^2 - 2*(26 sin B)(26 sin C) cos A

Simplify:

676 sin² A= 676 sin² B + 676 sin² C - 2*676 sin B sin C cos A

Divide both sides by 676:

sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos A

Hmm, that seems manageable.

Also, since A + B + C=180, so B + C=180 - A.

So, sin(B + C)=sin(180 - A)=sin A.

So, sin(B + C)=sin A.

But sin(B + C)=sin B cos C + cos B sin C.

Therefore, sin A= sin B cos C + cos B sin C.

So, that's another equation.

So, now, I have:

1. sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos A

2. sin A= sin B cos C + cos B sin C

Hmm, perhaps I can express sin² A in terms of sin B and sin C.

Alternatively, maybe express sin² A as [sin B cos C + cos B sin C]^2.

Wait, since sin A= sin B cos C + cos B sin C.

So, sin² A= [sin B cos C + cos B sin C]^2= sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos C cos B sin C + cos² B sin² C.

So, sin² A= sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C.

But from equation 1:

sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos A

So, set them equal:

sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C = sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos A

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps use the fact that in triangle ABC, cos A= -cos(B + C)= -(cos B cos C - sin B sin C)= -cos B cos C + sin B sin C.

Therefore, cos A= -cos B cos C + sin B sin C.

So, plug that into equation 1.

So, equation 1:

sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C [ -cos B cos C + sin B sin C ]

So, sin² A= sin² B + sin² C + 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C - 2 sin² B sin² C

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I can write sin² A as [sin B cos C + cos B sin C]^2, as before.

Which is sin² A= sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C

But from equation 1:

sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos A

But cos A= -cos B cos C + sin B sin C.

So, equation 1 becomes:

sin² A= sin² B + sin² C - 2 sin B sin C [ -cos B cos C + sin B sin C ]

So, sin² A= sin² B + sin² C + 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C - 2 sin² B sin² C

Therefore, sin² A= sin² B + sin² C + 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C - 2 sin² B sin² C

But from the expansion of sin² A, we have:

sin² A= sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C

So, equate the two expressions:

sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C = sin² B + sin² C + 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C - 2 sin² B sin² C

Hmm, let's subtract the right-hand side from both sides:

sin² B cos² C + 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C + cos² B sin² C - sin² B - sin² C - 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C + 2 sin² B sin² C =0

Simplify term by term:

sin² B cos² C - sin² B= sin² B (cos² C -1)= -sin² B sin² C

Similarly, cos² B sin² C - sin² C= sin² C (cos² B -1)= -sin² C cos² B

Then, 2 sin B cos B sin C cos C - 2 sin B sin C cos B cos C=0

And +2 sin² B sin² C.

So, putting all together:

- sin² B sin² C - sin² C cos² B + 2 sin² B sin² C=0

Factor sin² C:

sin² C (- sin² B - cos² B + 2 sin² B)=0

Simplify inside the brackets:

- sin² B - cos² B + 2 sin² B= ( - sin² B - cos² B ) + 2 sin² B= ( - (sin² B + cos² B) ) + 2 sin² B= -1 + 2 sin² B

So, equation becomes:

sin² C (-1 + 2 sin² B)=0

Thus, either sin² C=0, which would imply C=0, which is impossible in a triangle, or -1 + 2 sin² B=0.

So, -1 + 2 sin² B=0 → 2 sin² B=1 → sin² B=1/2 → sin B=√2/2.

Therefore, angle B=45 degrees or 135 degrees.

But in a triangle, angles are less than 180, so angle B=45 degrees or 135.

But if angle B=135 degrees, then angle A + angle C=45 degrees.

But from earlier, angle A≈57.4 degrees, which would make angle C≈-12.6 degrees, which is impossible.

Therefore, angle B=45 degrees.

So, angle B=45 degrees, angle A≈57.4 degrees, so angle C≈180 -57.4 -45≈77.6 degrees.

So, angle C≈77.6 degrees.

So, sin C≈sin(77.6)≈0.975.

So, sin C≈0.975, sin B=√2/2≈0.7071.

So, now, let's compute sides:

a=26 sin A≈26 sin(57.4 degrees)≈26*0.841≈21.867

b=26 sin B≈26*(√2/2)≈26*0.7071≈18.384

c=26 sin C≈26*0.975≈25.35

So, approximately, a≈21.867, b≈18.384, c≈25.35

But we need the exact value of AB * AC, which is c*b.

But we can express b*c in terms of sines.

From above, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

Therefore, b*c=26² sin B sin C=676 sin B sin C.

We need sin B sin C.

We have angle B=45 degrees, angle C≈77.6 degrees.

But angle C=180 - A - B.

But angle A can be computed.

Wait, angle A is approximately 57.4 degrees.

But perhaps we can find sin B sin C in terms of known quantities.

We have angle A=57.4 degrees, angle B=45 degrees, so angle C≈77.6 degrees.

Alternatively, since we have angle A, angle B, and angle C, we can compute sin B sin C.

But let me think differently.

From the Law of Sines, a/sin A= b/sin B= c/sin C=26.

So, a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, b*c=26² sin B sin C=676 sin B sin C.

But we can express sin B sin C using product-to-sum identities:

sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] /2

We know angle B=45 degrees, angle C=180 - A - B=180 - A -45.

But angle A is such that sin(A/2)=√39 /13.

Wait, angle A=2 arcsin(√39 /13).

So, angle A≈57.4 degrees, as before.

So, angle C=180 -57.4 -45≈77.6 degrees.

So, angle C≈77.6 degrees.

Therefore, B - C≈45 -77.6≈-32.6 degrees.

So, cos(B - C)=cos(-32.6)=cos(32.6)≈0.843.

And cos(B + C)=cos(45 +77.6)=cos(122.6)≈-0.535.

Therefore, sin B sin C≈[0.843 - (-0.535)] /2≈(1.378)/2≈0.689.

So, sin B sin C≈0.689.

Therefore, b*c≈676*0.689≈464.3.

But this is approximate.

But the problem is expecting an exact value.

So, perhaps we can find an exact expression.

Wait, let me recall that we had:

From the area formula:

6s= (1/2)*b*c*sin A

So, 12s= b*c*sin A

So, b*c=12s / sin A

So, if I can find s and sin A, then I can compute b*c.

But s is the semiperimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2.

But I also have s= a +2√30.

From earlier, s= a +2√30.

So, s= a +2√30.

But a=26 sin A.

So, s=26 sin A +2√30.

Therefore, b*c=12*(26 sin A +2√30)/ sin A= (12*26 sin A +24√30)/ sin A= 312 + (24√30)/sin A

Hmm, but we need to express sin A in terms of known quantities.

Wait, earlier, we had sin A=2√30, but that was incorrect because sin A can't be more than 1.

Wait, perhaps sin A is equal to something else.

Wait, in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, we had IA=2√39, OI=√13, AO=13.

So, IA² + OI²= AO² → 156 +13=169, which is correct.

But we also had IA=6 / sin(A/2)=2√39, so sin(A/2)=6/(2√39)=3/√39=√39 /13.

So, sin(A/2)=√39 /13.

Therefore, angle A=2 arcsin(√39 /13).

So, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39 /13)*(sqrt(1 - (39/169))).

Which is 2*(√39 /13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2√5070 /169=2*13√30 /169=26√30 /169=2√30 /13.

Wait, wait, that's different.

Wait, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39 /13)*(√130 /13)=2*(√(39*130))/13=2*sqrt(5070)/13.

But sqrt(5070)=sqrt(13² *30)=13*sqrt(30).

Therefore, sin A=2*(13√30)/13=2√30.

Wait, but sin A=2√30≈10.954>1, which is impossible.

Wait, this suggests that there is a contradiction.

But how?

Wait, in triangle AIO, right-angled at I, IA² + OI²= AO².

Which gives IA²=156, so IA=√156.

But if IA=6 / sin(A/2), then sin(A/2)=6 / IA=6 /√156=√156 /26=√(4*39)/26=2√39 /26=√39 /13≈0.4803.

So, sin(A/2)=√39 /13, so angle A/2≈28.7 degrees, so angle A≈57.4 degrees.

But then, sin A= sin(57.4 degrees)≈0.841, which is not equal to 2√30≈10.954.

Therefore, the error is that IA=√156, but in reality, IA=6 / sin(A/2)=√156, so sin(A/2)=6 /√156=√156 /26=√(4*39)/26=2√39 /26=√39 /13≈0.4803.

So, sin(A/2)=√39 /13, so angle A=2 arcsin(√39 /13).

Therefore, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39 /13)*(sqrt(1 - 39/169))=2*(√39 /13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*(√5070)/169=2*13√30 /169=26√30 /169=2√30 /13≈0.560.

Wait, hold on, sqrt(5070)=sqrt(13² *30)=13 sqrt(30). So:

sin A=2*(√39 /13)*(√130 /13)=2*(sqrt(39*130))/13=2*(sqrt(5070))/13=2*(13 sqrt(30))/13=2 sqrt(30).

Wait, so sin A=2 sqrt(30). But that's greater than 1. So, again, impossible.

This suggests that there is a flaw in my reasoning.

Wait, is it possible that triangle AIO is not right-angled? But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I.

Wait, but then how come sin A=2 sqrt(30)>1?

Therefore, the problem is inconsistent? But the problem is given, so I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the formula IA= r / sin(A/2) is incorrect.

Wait, let me refer to the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is:

IA= \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2}

Which we used earlier.

So, IA²= r² + (s -a)^2=36 + (s -a)^2=156.

So, (s -a)^2=120, so s -a=2 sqrt(30).

So, s= a +2 sqrt(30).

So, s= (a + b + c)/2= a +2 sqrt(30).

Thus, (a + b + c)/2= a +2 sqrt(30).

So, a + b + c=2a +4 sqrt(30).

Therefore, b + c= a +4 sqrt(30).

So, that's one equation.

Also, from Law of Sines:

a=26 sin A,

b=26 sin B,

c=26 sin C.

Also, A + B + C=180.

From the area formula:

Area= r*s=6s=6*(a +2 sqrt(30)).

Also, Area= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

Therefore,

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But b*c=26² sin B sin C.

So,

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= (1/2)*26² sin B sin C * sin A.

So,

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= (1/2)*676 sin B sin C sin A.

Simplify,

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= 338 sin B sin C sin A.

But a=26 sin A, so:

6*(26 sin A +2 sqrt(30))=338 sin B sin C sin A.

So,

156 sin A +12 sqrt(30)=338 sin B sin C sin A.

Hmm, that's a complicated equation.

But we also have angle A=2 arcsin(sqrt(39)/13).

So, angle A≈57.4 degrees.

And angle B=45 degrees, as found earlier.

So, angle C≈77.6 degrees.

Thus, sin B sin C≈0.7071 *0.975≈0.689.

So, plug in approximate values:

156 *0.841 +12*5.477≈156*0.841≈130.8 +12*5.477≈65.7≈196.5.

And 338 *0.689 *0.841≈338*0.578≈195.8.

So, approximately, both sides≈196.5, which is consistent.

So, the approximate value of b*c=26² sin B sin C≈676*0.689≈464.

But we need the exact value.

Wait, perhaps express sin B sin C in terms of angle A.

Given that angle B=45 degrees, angle C=180 - A -45=135 - A.

So, sin C=sin(135 - A)=sin135 cos A - cos135 sin A= (√2/2)(cos A + sin A).

Therefore, sin B sin C= sin45 * sin(135 - A)= (√2/2)*( (√2/2)(cos A + sin A) )= (2/4)(cos A + sin A)= (1/2)(cos A + sin A).

Therefore, sin B sin C= (cos A + sin A)/2.

So, sin B sin C= (cos A + sin A)/2.

Therefore, from the area formula:

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= 338 * (cos A + sin A)/2 * sin A

So,

6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= 169*(cos A + sin A)* sin A

But a=26 sin A, so:

6*(26 sin A +2 sqrt(30))=169*(cos A + sin A) sin A

Simplify left side:

6*26 sin A +12 sqrt(30)=156 sin A +12 sqrt(30)

Right side:

169*(cos A sin A + sin² A)

So, equation becomes:

156 sin A +12 sqrt(30)=169 cos A sin A +169 sin² A

But sin A is known in terms of sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, sin A=2 sqrt(30). Wait, but sin A cannot be 2 sqrt(30). So, perhaps I need to re-express sin A.

Wait, from earlier:

sin(A/2)=√39 /13,

so cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - 39/169)=sqrt(130)/13.

Therefore, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(√39 /13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169=2*13 sqrt(30)/169=26 sqrt(30)/169=2 sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, plug sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13 into the equation.

Left side:

156*(2 sqrt(30)/13) +12 sqrt(30)= (156*2 sqrt(30))/13 +12 sqrt(30)=24 sqrt(30) +12 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30)

Right side:

169*(cos A*(2 sqrt(30)/13) + (2 sqrt(30)/13)^2 )

Compute each term:

First term: 169*(cos A*(2 sqrt(30)/13))=169*(2 sqrt(30)/13) cos A=13*2 sqrt(30) cos A=26 sqrt(30) cos A

Second term:169*((2 sqrt(30)/13)^2)=169*(4*30)/169=4*30=120.

So, right side=26 sqrt(30) cos A +120.

Therefore, equation becomes:

36 sqrt(30)=26 sqrt(30) cos A +120

Thus,

26 sqrt(30) cos A=36 sqrt(30) -120

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

26 cos A=36 - (120)/sqrt(30)

But 120/sqrt(30)= (120 sqrt(30))/30=4 sqrt(30).

So,

26 cos A=36 -4 sqrt(30)

Thus,

cos A=(36 -4 sqrt(30))/26= (18 -2 sqrt(30))/13.

So, cos A= (18 -2 sqrt(30))/13.

Therefore, angle A= arccos( (18 -2 sqrt(30))/13 )

But we can compute sin A, which is 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Wait, but earlier, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13≈0.560.

But according to the previous calculation, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13≈0.560.

So, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, back to equation:

36 sqrt(30)=26 sqrt(30) cos A +120

But cos A=(18 -2 sqrt(30))/13.

Therefore, 26 sqrt(30) cos A=26 sqrt(30)*(18 -2 sqrt(30))/13=2 sqrt(30)*(18 -2 sqrt(30))=36 sqrt(30) -4*30=36 sqrt(30)-120

Which is equal to left side:36 sqrt(30)-120=36 sqrt(30)-120=36 sqrt(30)-120.

So, it's consistent.

Therefore, everything checks out.

So, now, going back, we had:

b*c=12s / sin A.

But s= a +2 sqrt(30)=26 sin A +2 sqrt(30).

So, s=26 sin A +2 sqrt(30).

Therefore, b*c=12*(26 sin A +2 sqrt(30))/ sin A= (312 sin A +24 sqrt(30))/ sin A=312 + (24 sqrt(30))/ sin A.

But sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, (24 sqrt(30))/ sin A=24 sqrt(30)/(2 sqrt(30)/13)=24*13/2=12*13=156.

Therefore, b*c=312 +156=468.

So, the product AB * AC= b*c=468.

Therefore, the answer is 468.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{468}
</think>

Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( 13 \), and inradius \( 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter (OI):**
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}
   \]

2. **Length of IA:**
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) and \( \triangle AIO \) is right-angled at \( I \):
   \[
   IA^2 + OI^2 = AO^2 \implies IA^2 + 13 = 13^2 \implies IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]

3. **Using the formula for IA:**
   \[
   IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} \implies 2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} \implies \sin \frac{A}{2} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
   \]

4. **Calculating \( \sin A \):**
   \[
   \sin A = 2 \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \frac{A}{2}
   \]
   where \( \cos \frac{A}{2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \frac{A}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{130}{169}} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \)
   \[
   \sin A = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{5070}}{169} = \frac{2 \cdot 13\sqrt{30}}{169} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}
   \]

5. **Using the area formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s
   \]
   Also, \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot c \cdot \sin A \)
   \[
   6s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot c \cdot \sin A \implies 12s = b \cdot c \cdot \sin A
   \]
   where \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) and \( s - a = 2\sqrt{30} \)

6. **Expressing \( s \) and \( b \cdot c \):**
   \[
   s = a + 2\sqrt{30}
   \]
   \[
   b \cdot c = \frac{12s}{\sin A} = \frac{12(a + 2\sqrt{30})}{\sin A}
   \]
   Since \( a = 26 \sin A \):
   \[
   s = 26 \sin A + 2\sqrt{30}
   \]
   \[
   b \cdot c = \frac{12(26 \sin A + 2\sqrt{30})}{\sin A} = 312 + \frac{24\sqrt{30}}{\sin A}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{24\sqrt{30}}{\sin A} = \frac{24\sqrt{30}}{\frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}} = 156
   \]
   \[
   b \cdot c = 312 + 156 = 468
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \(\boxed{468}\).
