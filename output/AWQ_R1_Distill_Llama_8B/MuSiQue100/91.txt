Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question: "Besides the body of water by the city where Erwin Speckler died, and the Irish Channel, what else was lowered in the last cold phase?" The user mentioned that the final answer should be in as few words as possible, so I need to be concise.

First, I need to understand the context. The question is referring to a historical event or a specific instance where something was lowered, likely referring to a structure or object. The user mentioned two specific locations: the body of water by the city where Erwin Speckler died and the Irish Channel. So, the answer is about another thing that was lowered in the same period.

I recall that during the "last cold phase," which I think refers to a specific historical period, there were several notable engineering or construction projects. One major project was the lowering of the Thames River in London, but that doesn't fit because it's a river, not a structure. Wait, no, the Thames River itself wasn't lowered; perhaps it's referring to a dam or a barrier that was built to control the river's flow.

Another possibility is the lowering of the River Nith in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, as part of flood prevention measures. Or maybe it's about the lowering of Lake Erie or another Great Lake, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's referring to the lowering of the Thames Barrier in London, which is a structure. The Thames Barrier is a series of gates that can be raised or lowered to control the river's flow. If that's the case, then "the Thames Barrier" would be the answer.

I should also consider if there's another structure that was lowered. For example, the Oxbow Dam in the Netherlands was a major project, but I'm not sure if it was part of the same phase. Alternatively, the Lowering of the Rhine River in Germany, but again, that's a river, not a structure.

Given the options, the Thames Barrier seems like a strong candidate because it's a well-known engineering project related to water management, and it was indeed constructed in the late 20th century as part of a cold phase (maybe a period of low temperatures or a specific project name).

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely "the Thames Barrier."
