Let's analyze the timeline step by step to determine the possible times David could have visited the swimming pool.

1. **David's Wake-Up Time**: David woke up at 9am.

2. **Activities Throughout the Day**:
   - From 9am to 10am: David was working out at the gym (seen by Kimberly).
   - From 10am to 11am: No information about David's location.
   - From 11am to 12pm: David was watching a movie at the theater (seen by Michael).
   - From 12pm to 1pm: David was attending class (seen by Jennifer).
   - From 1pm to 2pm: David was buying a phone at the electronics store (seen by Jason).
   - From 2pm to 10pm: David was sitting on a rooftop (seen by William).

3. **Swimming Pool Closure**: The swimming pool was closed after 10pm.

4. **Possible Swimming Pool Visit**:
   - Between 10am to 11am: This is a possible window since there's no record of David's location during this time.
   - After 10pm: The swimming pool was closed, so David couldn't have gone there after 10pm.

5. **Eliminating Impossible Times**:
   - 9am to 10am: David was at the gym.
   - 11am to 12pm: David was at the theater.
   - 12pm to 1pm: David was in class.
   - 1pm to 2pm: David was buying a phone.
   - 2pm to 10pm: David was on the rooftop.
   - After 10pm: Swimming pool closed.

   Therefore, the only possible time David could have gone to the swimming pool is between **10am to 11am**.

**Answer:** (A) 10am to 11am
