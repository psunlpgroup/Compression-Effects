Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion that Joey is a wild turkey is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the premise lists six types of wild turkeys: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, Rio Grande, and Ocellated. So, these are the only six types of wild turkeys mentioned here.

Then, we have several statements about Tom:
1. Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey.
2. Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
3. Tom is not a Gould’s wild turkey.
4. Tom is neither a Merriam’s wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.
5. Tom is a wild turkey.

From these statements, I need to determine what kind of wild turkey Tom is, and then see if Joey must be a wild turkey.

Starting with the first four points, Tom is explicitly not in each of the first four types: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande. That leaves only one possibility: Ocellated wild turkey. Because there are only six types, and Tom is not any of the first five, he must be the sixth one, which is Ocellated.

So, Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey. Now, the conclusion is that Joey is a wild turkey. The question is, does the information provided allow us to conclude that Joey is a wild turkey?

Wait, the premise doesn't mention anything about Joey. It only talks about Tom. So, unless there's a logical connection between Tom and Joey that's implied, we can't make any conclusion about Joey based solely on Tom's type.

Looking back, the premises don't provide any information about Joey. They only state things about Tom. So, the fact that Tom is a wild turkey doesn't necessarily tell us anything about Joey. Joey could be anything, a wild turkey or not, because there's no link established between Tom and Joey.

Therefore, the conclusion that Joey is a wild turkey is uncertain because we don't have any information about Joey. The premises only discuss Tom, and there's no logical deduction that can be made about Joey.

The conclusion that Joey is a wild turkey is **uncertain** because the premises only provide information about Tom and do not mention Joey. Therefore, we cannot conclude Joey's species based on the given information.

**Answer:** The conclusion is uncertain.
