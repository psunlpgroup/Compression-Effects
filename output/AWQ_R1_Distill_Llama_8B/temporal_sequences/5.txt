Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Elizabeth's Wake-Up Time**: Elizabeth woke up at 6am.

2. **Sarah's Observation**: Sarah saw Elizabeth taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 8am to 9am.

3. **Jessica's Observation**: Jessica saw Elizabeth working out at the gym from 9am to 3pm.

4. **Betty's Observation**: Betty saw Elizabeth watching a movie at the theater from 3pm to 7pm.

5. **James's Observation**: James saw Elizabeth stretching at a yoga studio from 7pm to 8pm.

6. **Amusement Park Closing Time**: The amusement park was closed after 8pm.

To determine when Elizabeth could have gone to the amusement park, we need to identify overlapping or adjacent time windows when she wasn't observed elsewhere.

- Between 6am and 8am: Elizabeth was at home since she woke up at 6am and was seen by Sarah at 8am. This is a possible time for the amusement park.

- Between 8am and 9am: Sarah saw Elizabeth taking photos, so she was occupied during this time.

- Between 9am and 3pm: Jessica saw Elizabeth working out, indicating she was busy at the gym during this period.

- Between 3pm and 7pm: Betty saw Elizabeth watching a movie, meaning she was occupied at the theater during this time.

- Between 7pm and 8pm: James saw Elizabeth stretching at a yoga studio, so she was busy here.

Since the amusement park was closed after 8pm, Elizabeth could not have gone there after 8pm.

Therefore, the only feasible time for Elizabeth to have gone to the amusement park is between 6am and 8am.

**Answer:** (B) 6am to 8am
