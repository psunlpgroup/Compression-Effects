Alright, let's try to figure out when Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall. I'll start by listing out all the information we have.

First, Anthony woke up at 6am. That's his starting point. Then, Samantha saw him stretching at a yoga studio from 6am to 12pm. So, he was at the yoga studio during that time. After that, Nancy saw him driving to the water park from 12pm to 2pm. So, he was driving in that timeframe.

Next, David saw Anthony watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 3pm. So, he was at the theater during those hours. Then, William saw Anthony fixing their computer at the electronic store from 5pm to 6pm. So, he was at the store during that time.

Finally, Sarah saw Anthony reading at the library from 6pm to 7pm. So, he was at the library during that period.

Now, the orchestra hall was closed after 7pm, which means Anthony couldn't have been there after 7pm. But we need to find the overlapping times when he wasn't at any of these other places.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **6am to 12pm**: At yoga studio.
2. **12pm to 2pm**: At water park.
3. **2pm to 3pm**: At theater.
4. **5pm to 6pm**: At electronic store.
5. **6pm to 7pm**: At library.

So, the times when he wasn't at these places are:

- Between 3pm to 5pm: He wasn't at the theater, water park, or yoga studio. He was free to go to the orchestra hall.
- After 7pm: The orchestra hall was closed, so he couldn't have gone after that.

Therefore, the only possible time he could have gone to the orchestra hall is between **3pm to 5pm**.

Looking at the options:

(A) 12pm to 2pm – He was at the water park then.
(B) 6pm to 7pm – He was at the library.
(C) 3pm to 5pm – This is when he wasn't at any of the other places.
(D) 2pm to 3pm – He was at the theater.

So, the correct answer is option (C).
