Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Nancy could have gone to the beach. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it all fits together.

First, Nancy woke up at 11am. That's a key starting point. Then, Tiffany saw Nancy stretching at a yoga studio from 11am to 2pm. So, during that time, Nancy was at the yoga studio. That means from 11am to 2pm, she wasn't at the beach.

Next, Linda saw Nancy buying cookies at a bakery from 4pm to 5pm. So, during that window, Nancy was shopping for cookies, not at the beach. Also, Mary saw Nancy waiting at the train station from 5pm to 8pm. So, from 5pm to 8pm, she was waiting there.

The beach was closed after 8pm, which means that if Nancy went to the beach, she would have had to do so before 8pm.

Now, let's see when she wasn't doing any of those activities. She was at the yoga studio from 11am to 2pm, at the bakery from 4pm to 5pm, and at the train station from 5pm to 8pm. So, the only times she wasn't doing those things are between 2pm to 4pm and 5pm to 8pm. But wait, from 5pm to 8pm, she was actually at the train station, so that time is taken up by her waiting there.

That leaves the time between 2pm to 4pm as a possible window when she could have gone to the beach. However, from 4pm to 5pm, she was buying cookies, so she couldn't have been at the beach then.

So, the only time that fits is between 2pm to 4pm. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. She was at the yoga studio until 2pm, then she must have been elsewhere until 4pm, when she started buying cookies. Since the beach was closed after 8pm, and she was at the train station until then, the only free time she had was between 2pm to 4pm.

Therefore, the answer should be between 2pm to 4pm.

The correct answer is (C) 2pm to 4pm.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Nancy was at the yoga studio from 11am to 2pm.
2. She bought cookies from 4pm to 5pm.
3. She waited at the train station from 5pm to 8pm.
4. The beach was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone after that.
5. The only free time between activities is from 2pm to 4pm.
