Alright, let's try to figure out during which time Hannah could have gone to the park based on the information provided.

First, let's list out all the events and the times when they occurred:

1. **Hannah wakes up at 11am.**
2. **Michael saw Hannah getting a coffee at the cafe from 11am to 3pm.**
3. **James saw Hannah buying clothes at the mall from 3pm to 4pm.**
4. **Hannah saw Hannah walking in the garden from 6pm to 8pm.**
5. **Lisa saw Hannah sitting on a rooftop from 8pm to 9pm.**
6. **Tiffany saw Hannah waiting at the train station from 9pm to 10pm.**
7. **The park was closed after 10pm.**

Now, let's try to piece this together step by step.

- **From 11am to 3pm:** Hannah is getting coffee with Michael.
- **At 3pm to 4pm:** She's buying clothes at the mall with James.
- **From 6pm to 8pm:** She's walking in the garden.
- **From 8pm to 9pm:** She's sitting on the rooftop with Lisa.
- **From 9pm to 10pm:** She's waiting at the train station with Tiffany.
- **After 10pm:** The park is closed.

So, during these times, Hannah is doing various activities, but when exactly could she have gone to the park?

Looking at the timeline:

- Between **3pm to 4pm:** She's at the mall.
- **From 4pm to 6pm:** There's no information about her location during this time. This is the window we need to check.
- **From 6pm onward:** She's either walking in the garden, sitting on the rooftop, or waiting at the train station.

Since the park was closed after 10pm, Hannah couldn't have gone to the park after 10pm.

Therefore, the only available window when she wasn't accounted for is **4pm to 6pm**.

Now, let's verify the options provided:

(A) 4pm to 6pm  
(B) 6pm to 8pm  
(C) 8pm to 9pm  
(D) 3pm to 4pm

Based on our analysis, the correct time when Hannah could have gone to the park is **4pm to 6pm**.

**Answer:** (A) 4pm to 6pm
