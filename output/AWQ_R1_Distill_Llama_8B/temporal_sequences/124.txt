To determine the possible times Jessica could have gone to the bookstore, let's analyze the timeline provided:

1. **Jessica's wake-up time**: 6am.
2. **Susan's observation**: Saw Jessica at the gym from 8am to 9am.
3. **Andrew's observation**: Saw Jessica driving from 9am to 10am.
4. **David's observation**: Saw Jessica walking from 10am to 1pm.
5. **Linda's observation**: Saw Jessica buying lunch from 1pm to 8pm.
6. **James's observation**: Saw Jessica taking photos from 8pm to 9pm.
7. **Bookstore hours**: Closed after 9pm.

From the timeline, Jessica is occupied from 8am to 9pm. The bookstore closes at 9pm, so she would not have had time to go there after that. However, there's a gap between 6am and 8am when Jessica was awake but not observed doing anything specific related to the bookstore.

Considering the available options:
- **(B) 6am to 8am**: This aligns with the time when Jessica was awake and no specific activities were observed, making it the most plausible time she could have gone to the bookstore.

**Answer: (B)**
