Alright, so I need to figure out the meaning of a word related to the majority religion in the area that became India when the country where the BCCI is based was created, according to the Arabic dictionary. First, I should break down the question.

The BCCI is based in India, right? So the country where BCCI is based is India. Now, when India became a country, that was a specific time in history. I think India gained independence from the British Empire in 1947. So the area that became India refers to the modern-day country of India.

Next, the majority religion in that area. India is a diverse country with multiple religions, but the majority religion is Hinduism. So the word we're looking for is related to Hinduism.

Now, the word should be in the Arabic dictionary. The term for Hinduism in Arabic is "الهندوسية" (al-Hinduusiyyah). However, the question asks for the meaning of the word that is also the majority religion in the area that became India when the country where BCCI is based was created. So the word is "الهندوسية," which means Hinduism.

I should make sure it's the correct term and its meaning. Yes, "الهندوسية" translates to Hinduism in English. So the final answer should be concise, in Arabic, but the user wants the meaning in English, so probably the word "Hinduism" is sufficient.
