Alright, let's try to figure out when Ashley could have gone to the basketball court. 

First, I know that Ashley woke up at 7am. That's the earliest time she could have possibly left the house. 

Next, let's look at the times when others saw Ashley:

- **Lisa** saw Ashley at the office from 7am to 8am. So, during that time, Ashley was at work.
- **Michael** saw Ashley walking in the garden from 8am to 10am. So, after 8am, she was out in the garden until 10am.
- **Samantha** saw Ashley at school from 1pm to 6pm. That means Ashley was busy at school during that period.
- The **basketball court was closed after 6pm**, which means the latest Ashley could have gone there is before 6pm.

Now, let's see when Ashley wasn't accounted for:

- From 7am to 8am: Ashley was at the office (Lisa saw her).
- From 8am to 10am: Ashley was in the garden (Michael saw her).
- From 1pm to 6pm: Ashley was at school (Samantha saw her).

So, the only times Ashley wasn't seen by anyone are between 10am and 1pm. That's when she could have possibly gone to the basketball court.

Let me double-check the timeline:

- **7am to 8am**: At the office.
- **8am to 10am**: In the garden.
- **10am to 1pm**: Free time.
- **1pm to 6pm**: At school.
- **After 6pm**: Basketball court is closed.

Yes, it seems like the only available time is between 10am and 1pm.

So, the correct answer should be **(C) 10am to 1pm**.
</think>

The correct answer is (C) 10am to 1pm.

**Answer: (C)**
