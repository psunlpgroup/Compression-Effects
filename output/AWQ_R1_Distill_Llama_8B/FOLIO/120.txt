Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The premises are:

1. Some affection is love.
2. Some love is positive.

And the conclusion is:

Some affection is positive.

Alright, let's break this down. The first premise says that some affection is love. That means there exists a subset of affection where each element in that subset is also love. So, if I have a Venn diagram, the "affection" circle overlaps with the "love" circle, but only part of the affection is love.

The second premise states that some love is positive. So within the love circle, there's a part that overlaps with the "positive" circle. That means not all love is positive, just a portion of it.

Now, the conclusion is that some affection is positive. Let me see if this follows. Since some affection is love (from premise 1), and some of that love is positive (from premise 2), it follows that those specific instances of affection (which are love) are also positive. Therefore, there's an overlap between affection and positive.

I think this makes sense because if you have a part of affection that's love, and that part of love is positive, then that part of affection must be positive as well. So, the conclusion should be true.

Wait, is there any possibility that this might not hold? Let me consider if the premises could be true but the conclusion false. Suppose affection and love are almost entirely separate except for a tiny bit. And within that tiny bit of love, some is positive. But the conclusion is about affection, which includes more than just that tiny bit. So, does that mean that all affection is positive? No, because only the overlapping part (which is love) is positive, but the rest of affection might not be. However, the conclusion is "some" affection is positive, which is true because the overlapping part exists.

So, the conclusion is definitely true because the premises establish a pathway where a portion of affection is positive.

The conclusion is true because the premises establish that a portion of affection, which is love, overlaps with positive. Therefore, some affection is positive.

**Answer:** True.
