The phrase "operator of the list of destroyer classes of the operator of the USS ZigZag seals" is a bit convoluted, but it seems to be referring to the operator of the list of destroyer classes associated with the USS ZigZag. The word "seals" here likely refers to the official seals or emblems associated with those destroyers. So, the operator would be the person or entity responsible for managing or overseeing the list of destroyer classes related to the USS ZigZag.

In fewer words: The operator oversees the destroyer classes of the USS ZigZag.
