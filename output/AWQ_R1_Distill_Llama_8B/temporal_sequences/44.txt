Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Michael could have gone to the physics classroom. So, let's break down the information we have step by step.

First, Michael wakes up at 5am. That's our starting point.

Then, Samantha saw Michael buying lunch at the deli from 5am to 8am. So, Michael was at the deli during that time.

Next, Jennifer saw Michael stretching at a yoga studio from 8am to 9am. So, after the deli visit, Michael went to the yoga studio.

Then, Andrew saw Michael taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 1pm to 10pm. Hmm, that's a bit later in the day.

Also, it's mentioned that the physics classroom was closed after 10pm. So, the physics classroom was only open until 10pm.

Now, we need to figure out when Michael could have possibly gone to the physics classroom. Let's piece this together.

Michael was at the deli from 5am to 8am and then at the yoga studio from 8am to 9am. So, after 9am, where was Michael? The next time Andrew saw him was from 1pm to 10pm, taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Wait a second, there's a big gap between 9am and 1pm. So, during that time, Michael wasn't doing any of the activities mentioned. That's probably when he went to the physics classroom.

But let's make sure. The physics classroom was closed after 10pm, so Michael couldn't have gone there after 10pm. But he was taking photos until 10pm, so that's when he was at the Tower of Pisa.

Therefore, Michael must have gone to the physics classroom between 9am and 1pm.

Looking at the options, that's option (A): 9am to 1pm.

But wait, let's double-check. The deli was from 5am to 8am, yoga from 8am to 9am, and then he was at the Tower of Pisa from 1pm to 10pm. So, between 9am and 1pm, he wasn't doing anything else mentioned. That's the time he could have gone to the physics classroom.

So, the correct answer should be (A) 9am to 1pm.

The correct answer is (A) 9am to 1pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Michael's Morning Activities:**
   - Wakes up at 5am.
   - Saw buying lunch at the deli from 5am to 8am by Samantha.
   - Then saw at the yoga studio from 8am to 9am by Jennifer.

2. **Afternoon and Evening Activities:**
   - After 9am, the next activity is at 1pm by Andrew near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, lasting until 10pm.

3. **Physics Classroom Availability:**
   - The classroom is closed after 10pm, so Michael could have visited before 10pm.

4. **Determine Possible Time for Physics Classroom Visit:**
   - Between 9am and 1pm, Michael wasn't seen by anyone else, so this is the likely time he visited the physics classroom.

**Answer:** (A) 9am to 1pm
