Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion "Some Greeks are mortal" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down the premises.

The first premise is "All humans are mortal." That means every single human being dies eventually. So, if someone is a human, they are mortal. Got it.

The second premise is "All Greeks are humans." Hmm, so every Greek is a member of the human species. That makes sense because Greeks are people, right? So, if all Greeks are humans, then they fall under the category of being mortal because all humans are mortal.

Now, the conclusion is "Some Greeks are mortal." So, does this follow logically from the premises? Let me think about it step by step.

If all Greeks are humans, and all humans are mortal, then it must be the case that all Greeks are also mortal. Wait, but the conclusion says "some Greeks are mortal." Is that the same as all Greeks being mortal?

Hmm, actually, if every Greek is a human, and every human is mortal, then every Greek is mortal. So, the statement "Some Greeks are mortal" is actually a weaker statement than "All Greeks are mortal." But logically, if all Greeks are mortal, then it's definitely true that some Greeks are mortal because every single Greek is mortal.

Wait, but sometimes in logic, the way the statements are phrased can change things. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The premises don't say anything about the number of Greeks or humans, just their categories. So, the set of Greeks is entirely within the set of humans, which are all mortal.

Therefore, every Greek is mortal, which implies that some Greeks are mortal. Because even if there were only one Greek, that one would be mortal, making the conclusion true. So, the conclusion follows logically.

I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The premises establish a subset relationship where Greeks are a subset of humans, who are all mortal. So, the conclusion must be true.

The conclusion "Some Greeks are mortal" is **true** based on the premises. All Greeks, being human, are mortal, making it certain that some Greeks are mortal.

**Answer:** True
