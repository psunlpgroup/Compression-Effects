["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out this question. It's a bit of a tongue-twister, but I'll break it down step by step. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] First, the question mentions "state A" where "Storm of the Century" was filmed. So, I need to find out which state that is. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] I know "Storm of the Century" is a TV show, and I recall it's based on the book by a specific author. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The book's author is mentioned in the question, but it's hidden in a riddle. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] The next clue is that the author also wrote a short story featuring the author of "This Is My God." That seems a bit confusing, but I'll try to untangle it. Let's parse it: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 1. There's an author who wrote a short story. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 2. That short story features the author of "This Is My God." ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the author of "This Is My God" is a character in a short story written by another author. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, connecting this back to the first part: the author of "Storm of the Century" wrote a book, and this book's author is the same as the one who wrote the short story that features the author of "This Is My God." ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Putting it all together, the author of "Storm of the Century" wrote a book where the main character is the author of "This Is My God." ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] I think the author in question here is Bret Ray Brown, who wrote "This Is My God." ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, Bret Ray Brown also wrote "Storm of the Century," and in that book, he features himself as the author of "This Is My God." ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the state A where "Storm of the Century" was filmed is based on this information. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Since Bret Ray Brown is from Missouri, and the show is based on his life, the state A is likely Missouri. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] So, the population of state A, which is Missouri, is approximately 6,093,580 people. ["end-section"]
