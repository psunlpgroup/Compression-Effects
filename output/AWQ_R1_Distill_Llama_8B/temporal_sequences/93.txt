Alright, let's try to figure out during what times Nancy could have gone to the bookstore. I'll go through the information step by step to understand the timeline and possible windows when she could have visited.

First, let's list out all the events and the times associated with them:

1. **Nancy woke up at 8am.**
   
   This is her early morning time. She's just starting her day.

2. **Jennifer saw Nancy buying cookies at a bakery from 8am to 9am.**
   
   So, between 8am and 9am, Nancy was at the bakery purchasing cookies. That means during this one-hour window, she was specifically at the bakery.

3. **William saw Nancy taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 12pm.**
   
   After leaving the bakery, Nancy went to take photos near the Eiffel Tower. This activity took place from 9am until 12pm, which is a three-hour window.

4. **Mary saw Nancy playing tennis at the tennis court from 12pm to 2pm.**
   
   Following her photo session, Nancy engaged in tennis from 12pm to 2pm. This is another two-hour window.

5. **The bookstore was closed after 9pm.**
   
   This piece of information tells us that the bookstore's operating hours ended at 9pm. So, after 9pm, the store was closed.

Now, let's piece this together.

Nancy's activities:

- **8am to 9am:** At the bakery buying cookies.
- **9am to 12pm:** Taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
- **12pm to 2pm:** Playing tennis at the tennis court.

So, based on this, Nancy was occupied from 8am until 2pm. She was not free to go to the bookstore during these times because she was either buying cookies, taking photos, or playing tennis.

But we also know that the bookstore was closed after 9pm. So, after 9pm, the store was not open. Therefore, Nancy couldn't have gone to the bookstore after 9pm.

Putting it all together, Nancy was busy from 8am to 2pm. The only time she wasn't occupied and the bookstore was still open would be during the hours she wasn't seen by Jennifer, William, or Mary.

Looking at her schedule:

- **8am to 9am:** Busy at the bakery.
- **9am to 12pm:** Busy taking photos.
- **12pm to 2pm:** Busy playing tennis.

So, there are no gaps in her schedule where she was free to visit the bookstore during the times the store was open (before 9pm).

However, the problem is asking "Between what times could they have gone?" This implies that there is a possible window when she wasn't occupied, allowing her to visit the bookstore.

But based on the given information, she was continuously occupied from 8am to 2pm, and the store was open until 9pm. So, the only time she wasn't seen is before 8am, but she just woke up at 8am. So, she didn't have any free time before 8am to visit the store.

Wait, but the problem says she went to the bookstore. So, she must have found a window when she wasn't occupied or when the store was open.

Looking again, she was at the bakery from 8-9am, then Eiffel Tower from 9-12pm, then tennis from 12-2pm. So, after 2pm, she was free. But the store was closed after 9pm. So, she could have gone to the bookstore between 2pm and 9pm, as she was free, and the store was still open.

Wait, but the options are:

(A) 12pm to 2pm

(B) 8am to 9am

(C) 2pm to 9pm

(D) 9am to 12pm

So, the correct answer should be option (C) 2pm to 9pm because after 2pm, she was free, and the store was open until 9pm.

So, the timeline is:

- 8-9am: Buying cookies

- 9-12pm: Taking photos

- 12-2pm: Playing tennis

- 2pm onwards: Free, but store closes at 9pm, so she could have gone anytime between 2pm and 9pm.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the correct answer is (C) 2pm to 9pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (C) 2pm to 9pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Nancy's schedule:**
   - 8am to 9am: Buying cookies.
   - 9am to 12pm: Taking photos.
   - 12pm to 2pm: Playing tennis.

2. **Determine when she was free:**
   - After 2pm, she was free until the bookstore closed at 9pm.

3. **Check the store's operating hours:**
   - The store was open until 9pm.

4. **Combine the above:**
   - Nancy could have visited the bookstore anytime between 2pm and 9pm when she was free and the store was open.

**Answer:** (C) 2pm to 9pm
