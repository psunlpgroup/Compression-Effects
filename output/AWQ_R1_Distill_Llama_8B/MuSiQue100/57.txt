To determine the seat of the county that shares a border with J. P. Hayes's birth county, I'll first need to identify the specific county where J. P. Hayes was born. Since the question doesn't provide this information, I'll consider it as a variable, say **County A**.

Next, I'll identify which counties share a border with **County A**. To do this, I'll need to know the neighboring counties of **County A**. However, without specific geographical information about **County A**, I can't pinpoint the exact neighboring counties.

Once I have the list of neighboring counties, I'll look up the seat of each one to find the correct answer. However, without knowing the exact neighboring counties, I can't proceed further.

Therefore, the final answer depends on knowing the specific county where J. P. Hayes was born and its neighboring counties.
