Alright, let's try to figure out when Anthony could have gone to the basketball court. So, here's what we know:

1. **Anthony's Day:**
   - He wakes up at 5 AM.
   - Then, Sarah sees him buying clothes at the mall from 5 AM to 7 AM.
   - After that, Tiffany sees him buying lunch at the deli from 7 AM to 12 PM.
   - Next, Sean spots him watching a movie at the theater from 12 PM to 2 PM.
   - Finally, Emily sees him buying a phone at the electronics store from 2 PM to 4 PM.

2. **Basketball Court Schedule:**
   - The court is open from 9 AM to 9 PM.
   - It closes after 9 PM.

So, the question is: Between what times could Anthony have gone to the basketball court?

Let's break it down step by step.

**First, let's list all the times when Anthony is seen by Sarah, Tiffany, Sean, and Emily:**

- **Sarah:** 5 AM to 7 AM
- **Tiffany:** 7 AM to 12 PM
- **Sean:** 12 PM to 2 PM
- **Emily:** 2 PM to 4 PM

These are the times when Anthony is occupied elsewhere.

Now, we need to find the time windows when Anthony is **not** seen by anyone, meaning he could have gone to the basketball court.

So, let's subtract the times when he's seen from the total timeline.

**Total timeline from 5 AM to 4 PM:**

- From 5 AM to 4 PM, Anthony is either seen by Sarah, Tiffany, Sean, or Emily.

But the basketball court is open from 9 AM to 9 PM. So, we need to see if there's any overlap between the times he's not seen and the basketball court's operating hours.

Let's analyze the time intervals:

1. **From 5 AM to 7 AM:**
   - Sarah sees Anthony.
   - Basketball court is open from 9 AM, so no overlap here.

2. **From 7 AM to 12 PM:**
   - Tiffany sees Anthony.
   - Basketball court is open during this time (9 AM to 12 PM).
   - So, there's an overlap. But does that mean he went to the court during this time? Not necessarily, because he's buying lunch.

3. **From 12 PM to 2 PM:**
   - Sean sees Anthony.
   - Basketball court is open (9 AM to 9 PM), so there's overlap.
   - Again, he's watching a movie, so he's not at the court.

4. **From 2 PM to 4 PM:**
   - Emily sees Anthony.
   - Basketball court is still open until 9 PM, so there's overlap.
   - He's buying a phone, so he's not at the court.

Now, we need to see if there's any time when Anthony is not seen by anyone and the court is open.

Looking at the total timeline from 5 AM to 4 PM:

- **5 AM to 7 AM:** He's with Sarah.
- **7 AM to 12 PM:** He's with Tiffany.
- **12 PM to 2 PM:** He's with Sean.
- **2 PM to 4 PM:** He's with Emily.

So, during all these times, he's occupied elsewhere. But the basketball court is open from 9 AM to 9 PM.

Wait, so is there any time after 4 PM when he could have gone to the court? But the question says "between what times could they have gone," and the options don't include times after 4 PM. The options are:

(A) 5am to 7am
(B) 12pm to 2pm
(C) 4pm to 9pm
(D) 7am to 12pm

Hmm, the options suggest that the possible times are during the day, not in the evening after 4 PM. But the basketball court is open until 9 PM, so theoretically, he could have gone after 4 PM.

But looking at the options, option (C) is 4pm to 9pm. That fits the time when the court is open, but he's not seen by anyone after 2 PM.

So, could he have gone to the basketball court anytime between 4 PM and 9 PM? Yes, because he's not seen by anyone during that time, and the court is open.

So, the correct answer is (C) 4pm to 9pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (C) 4pm to 9pm.

**Answer: (C)**
