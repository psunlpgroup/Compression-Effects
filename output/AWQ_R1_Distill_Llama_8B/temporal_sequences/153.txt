Alright, let's try to figure out when Hannah could have gone to the art show. I'll start by laying out all the information given and see how the times overlap.

First, Hannah woke up at 7 am. So, she was at home by 7 am.

Then, Michael saw Hannah walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 7 am to 8 am. That means between 7 and 8 am, Hannah was on her way to the Statue of Liberty.

Leslie saw Hannah reading at the library from 8 am to 9 am. So, after Michael saw her at 7-8 am, Leslie saw her at 8-9 am.

Jason saw Hannah sitting on a rooftop from 9 am to 1 pm. That's a longer periodâ€”9 am to 1 pm, so Hannah was sitting there for a while.

Lisa saw Hannah fixing their computer at the electronic store from 7 pm to 9 pm. So, after 7 pm, Hannah was busy fixing the computer.

Hannah saw Hannah watching a movie at the theater from 9 pm to 10 pm. So, at 9 pm, she saw her double, and they watched a movie until 10 pm.

The art show was closed after 10 pm. So, the latest time Hannah could have gone to the art show is before 10 pm.

Now, I need to see when Hannah was free to go to the art show. Let's list her activities:

- 7 am: Woke up.
- 7-8 am: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty (Michael saw her).
- 8-9 am: Reading at the library (Leslie saw her).
- 9 am-1 pm: Sitting on a rooftop (Jason saw her).
- 7 pm-9 pm: Fixing their computer (Lisa saw her).
- 9 pm-10 pm: Watching a movie (Hannah saw her).

So, the times when Hannah was occupied are from 7 am to 1 pm, and then again from 7 pm to 10 pm. The art show was closed after 10 pm, so the latest she could have gone is before 10 pm.

Looking at the options:

A) 7 pm to 9 pm: But she was fixing the computer during that time, so she couldn't have gone to the art show then.

B) 7 am to 8 am: She was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so she wasn't free to go to the art show.

C) 1 pm to 7 pm: This is a period when she was not occupied by her usual activities. She was probably free to go to the art show during this time.

D) 9 pm to 10 pm: She was watching a movie, so she couldn't have gone to the art show.

Therefore, the only possible time she could have gone to the art show is between 1 pm and 7 pm.
