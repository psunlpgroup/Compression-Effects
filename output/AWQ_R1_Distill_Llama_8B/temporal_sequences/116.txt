Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the soccer field based on the information provided.

First, William wakes up at 1pm. So, he starts his day at 1pm.

Next, Sarah saw William working at the office from 1pm to 2pm. That means William was at the office during that time.

Then, Mary saw William waiting at the train station from 2pm to 4pm. So, after leaving the office, William went to the train station and was there from 2pm to 4pm.

After that, Susan saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 8pm to 10pm. So, after the train station, William must have gone somewhere else, possibly the soccer field, and then later took photos near the Eiffel Tower.

The soccer field was closed after 10pm. That means William couldn't have been at the soccer field after 10pm because it was closed.

So, we need to find a time between when William was at the train station (2pm to 4pm) and before the soccer field closed after 10pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 8pm to 10pm: This is after the soccer field was closed, so William couldn't have gone then.

(B) 1pm to 2pm: William was at the office during this time, so he wasn't at the soccer field.

(C) 2pm to 4pm: This is when William was at the train station, so he wasn't at the soccer field.

(D) 4pm to 8pm: This is a period between when William was at the train station and when he took photos near the Eiffel Tower. The soccer field was open during this time, so this is a possible window.

Therefore, William could have gone to the soccer field between 4pm and 8pm.

**Answer:** (D) 4pm to 8pm
