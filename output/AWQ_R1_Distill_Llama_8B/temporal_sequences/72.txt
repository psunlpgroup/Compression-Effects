Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Ashley could have gone to the art studio. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, Ashley woke up at 5am. That's a key starting point. Then, Mary saw Ashley getting a coffee at the cafe from 5am to 6am. So, during that hour, Ashley was at the cafe.

Next, William saw Ashley buying a phone at the electronics store from 6am to 4pm. That's a much longer time periodâ€”almost 10 hours. So, Ashley was busy from 6am until 4pm.

After that, Jennifer saw Ashley buying a bike at the bike shop from 4pm to 5pm. So, right after buying the phone, Ashley went to buy a bike, which took another hour.

Then, Anthony saw Ashley waiting at the train station from 5pm to 6pm. So, after buying the bike, Ashley was at the train station for an hour.

Now, the art studio was closed after 8pm. That means Ashley couldn't have gone to the art studio after 8pm because the studio was already closed.

Let's piece this together step by step:

1. Ashley wakes up at 5am.
2. From 5am to 6am, Ashley is at the cafe with Mary.
3. From 6am to 4pm, Ashley is buying a phone with William.
4. From 4pm to 5pm, Ashley buys a bike with Jennifer.
5. From 5pm to 6pm, Ashley is at the train station with Anthony.

So, by the time Ashley gets to the train station at 6pm, the next activity she has is waiting there until 6pm. But the art studio was closed after 8pm, so Ashley couldn't have gone to the art studio after 8pm.

Looking at the timeline, the only time when Ashley wasn't occupied elsewhere and the art studio was still open is between 6pm and 8pm. That's when the art studio was likely open, and Ashley could have gone there.

Now, let's look at the options provided:

(A) 4pm to 5pm  
This is when Ashley is buying a bike, so she can't be at the art studio then.

(B) 6am to 4pm  
This is when Ashley is buying a phone, so she's not at the art studio.

(C) 6pm to 8pm  
This is the time after she's done buying the bike and before the train station, and the art studio is still open. This seems to fit.

(D) 5am to 6am  
This is when she's at the cafe, so not at the art studio.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6pm to 8pm.

The correct answer is (C) 6pm to 8pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Time Periods:**
   - Ashley wakes up at 5am.
   - From 5am to 6am: At the cafe.
   - From 6am to 4pm: At the electronics store.
   - From 4pm to 5pm: At the bike shop.
   - From 5pm to 6pm: At the train station.
   - Art studio is closed after 8pm.

2. **Determine Available Time for Art Studio Visit:**
   - After 6pm, Ashley is at the train station until 6pm.
   - The art studio is open before 8pm.
   - Therefore, Ashley could have visited the art studio between 6pm and 8pm.

**Answer:** (C) 6pm to 8pm
