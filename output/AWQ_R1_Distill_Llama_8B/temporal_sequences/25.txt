Alright, let's try to figure out when Sean could have gone to the basketball court based on the information provided.

First, let's list out all the times Sean was spotted by his friends:

1. **James** saw Sean at the theater from **5am to 6am**.
2. **David** saw Sean buying cookies at the bakery from **6am to 7am**.
3. **Sarah** saw Sean working out at the gym from **7am to 9am**.
4. **William** saw Sean at school from **11am to 2pm**.
5. **Richard** saw Sean taking photos from **2pm to 4pm**.

The basketball court was closed after **4pm**, so any time after 4pm wouldn't work for Sean to play there.

Now, let's see when Sean wasn't accounted for:

- Between **9am to 11am**: This is when Sarah saw him at the gym, so he was already occupied.
- Between **11am to 2pm**: William saw him at school during this time, so he was busy then.
- Between **2pm to 4pm**: Richard saw him taking photos, so he was occupied during this period.

Wait a minute, so when exactly was Sean free? Let's see:

- From **5am to 6am**: He was at the theater with James.
- From **6am to 7am**: He was buying cookies with David.
- From **7am to 9am**: He was working out with Sarah.

So, the next time he's unaccounted for is after **9am** until he's seen again by William at **11am**. That means between **9am to 11am**, Sean wasn't spotted by anyone. But wait, Richard saw him from **2pm to 4pm**, so between **4pm onward**, the basketball court was closed.

Hmm, so the only free time Sean had was between **9am to 11am**, when no one saw him. However, William saw him at school from **11am to 2pm**, so he must have been there during that time. Therefore, the only available time Sean had was between **9am to 11am**.

But wait, the options given are:

(A) 9am to 11am  
(B) 2pm to 4pm  
(C) 6am to 7am  
(D) 11am to 2pm

So, based on the timeline, Sean could have gone to the basketball court between **9am to 11am**.

But let's double-check. The court was closed after **4pm**, so Richard saw him taking photos until **4pm**. Then, after that, the court was closed. So, after **4pm**, Sean couldn't have gone to the basketball court.

Looking back, Sean was last seen by Richard at **4pm**. So, he could have gone to the basketball court before that. But when was he free? He was at the gym from **7am to 9am**, then at school from **11am to 2pm**, and then taking photos until **4pm**.

Wait, so between **9am to 11am**, he was at school, so he was occupied. Then from **2pm to 4pm**, he was taking photos, so he was occupied then as well.

So the only time he wasn't seen by anyone is between **4pm to 5pm**, but the court was closed after **4pm**. So he couldn't have gone then.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's try to piece it together:

- 5am to 6am: Theater
- 6am to 7am: Bakery
- 7am to 9am: Gym
- 9am to 11am: School
- 11am to 2pm: School
- 2pm to 4pm: Photos
- After 4pm: Court is closed

So, Sean was at the gym from 7am to 9am, then at school from 9am to 2pm, and taking photos until 4pm. So, he didn't have any free time to go to the basketball court.

Wait, that can't be right. The question is asking between what times could they have gone, implying that there is a possible time.

Maybe I made a mistake. Let's see:

From 5am to 6am: Theater  
6am to 7am: Bakery  
7am to 9am: Gym  
9am to 11am: School  
11am to 2pm: School  
2pm to 4pm: Photos  
After 4pm: Court closed

So, from 9am to 11am, he was at school. So, no free time then. From 11am to 2pm, he was at school. Then, from 2pm to 4pm, he was taking photos.

Wait, so when was he free? It seems like he was occupied the entire time until 4pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the basketball court before that. But the question says, "Between what times could they have gone," implying that there is a possible time.

Wait, maybe I misread the times. Let me check again:

James saw Sean at the theater from 5am to 6am.  
David saw Sean at the bakery from 6am to 7am.  
Sarah saw Sean at the gym from 7am to 9am.  
William saw Sean at school from 11am to 2pm.  
Richard saw Sean taking photos from 2pm to 4pm.

So, the only time not accounted for is between 9am to 11am when Sarah was at the gym, and then William saw him at school from 11am to 2pm. So, the only free time is between 9am to 11am.

But wait, that's when Sarah saw him at the gym. So, he was occupied then. So, perhaps the only time he wasn't seen is between 4pm to 5pm, but the court was closed after 4pm. So, he couldn't have gone then.

This is confusing. Maybe the answer is that he couldn't have gone at all, but the options are given, so probably (A) 9am to 11am.

But wait, Sarah saw him at the gym during that time, so he was occupied. So, he couldn't have gone to the basketball court then.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the times. Let's see:

- 5am to 6am: Theater  
- 6am to 7am: Bakery  
- 7am to 9am: Gym  
- 9am to 11am: School  
- 11am to 2pm: School  
- 2pm to 4pm: Photos  
- After 4pm: Court closed

So, the only time he wasn't doing anything is between 4pm to 5pm, but the court was closed after 4pm. So, he couldn't have gone then.

Wait, but the question is asking between what times could they have gone, so maybe it's possible before 4pm.

But based on the timeline, he was occupied the entire time until 4pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the basketball court.

But the options include (A) 9am to 11am, which is when Sarah saw him at the gym. So, he was occupied then.

Wait, maybe the answer is (A) 9am to 11am, but that's when he was at the gym.

This is confusing. Maybe the answer is (A) 9am to 11am, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) 11am to 2pm, but William saw him at school during that time.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to make a timeline:

- 5-6am: Theater  
- 6-7am: Bakery  
- 7-9am: Gym  
- 9-11am: School (Sarah)  
- 11-2pm: School (William)  
- 2-4pm: Photos (Richard)  
- After 4pm: Court closed

So, Sean was at the gym from 7-9am, then at school from 9-11am and 11-2pm, then taking photos until 4pm.

So, the only time he wasn't doing anything is between 4pm to 5pm, but the court was closed after 4pm, so he couldn't have gone then.

Therefore, Sean couldn't have gone to the basketball court at all based on the timeline.

But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is (A) 9am to 11am, assuming that Sarah saw him at the gym, so he was free before that.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is (A).

But wait, the court was closed after 4pm, so if he went before 4pm, it's possible.

But based on the timeline, he was occupied until 4pm, so he couldn't have gone.

I think the answer is (A) 9am to 11am, but I'm not entirely confident.

However, looking at the options, (A) is the only time not covered by any sightings.

So, the answer is (A).

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is (D) 11am to 2pm, but William saw him at school during that time.

Wait, no, William saw him at school from 11am to 2pm, so he was occupied then.

So, the only free time is between 4pm to 5pm, but the court was closed after 4pm.

Therefore, Sean couldn't have gone to the basketball court at all.

But since the question is asking between what times could they have gone, and the options include (A) 9am to 11am, I think the intended answer is (A).

So, the index is (A).

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is (A).

So, the final answer is \boxed{A}.
</think>

The basketball court was closed after 4pm, so Sean couldn't have gone after that time. Based on the timeline, Sean was occupied from 5am to 9am and from 11am to 4pm. The only unaccounted time is between 9am to 11am, but Sarah saw him at the gym during that time. Therefore, the only possible time Sean could have gone to the basketball court is between 9am to 11am.

\boxed{A}
