["initializing"]Okay, so I need to figure out between what times David could have gone to the gas station. Let's start by laying out all the information given.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, David woke up at 7am. That's the earliest time we know.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Then, Michael saw David waiting at the train station from 7am to 12pm. So, Michael saw him between 7am and noon.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Next, Thomas saw David sitting on a rooftop from 12pm to 2pm. So, Thomas saw him between noon and 2pm.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Tiffany saw David getting a coffee at the cafe from 2pm to 3pm. So, Tiffany saw him between 2pm and 3pm.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]James saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 5pm. So, James saw him between 3pm and 5pm.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Mark saw David reading at the library from 5pm to 6pm. So, Mark saw him between 5pm and 6pm.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]The gas station was closed after 8pm. So, the gas station was open until 8pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Now, I need to figure out during which time David could have gone to the gas station based on these observations.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Let's list out the times when David was seen by others: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]- 7am to 12pm (Michael) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]- 12pm to 2pm (Thomas) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]- 2pm to 3pm (Tiffany) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]- 3pm to 5pm (James) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]- 5pm to 6pm (Mark) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]And the gas station was open until 8pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the times when David was seen don't include 6pm to 8pm, except for Mark, who saw him up until 6pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"]But since the gas station was closed after 8pm, David wouldn't have gone there after 8pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Looking at the options: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"](A) 2pm to 3pm ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"](B) 6pm to 8pm ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"](C) 5pm to 6pm ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"](D) 7am to 12pm ["end-section"]

["deduction"]From the timeline, David was at the gas station possibly during the 5pm to 6pm window, as that's when Mark saw him.["end-section"]

["deduction"]But also, 6pm to 8pm is when the gas station was closed, so he couldn't have gone then.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the correct time would be 5pm to 6pm, which is option C.["end-section"]
