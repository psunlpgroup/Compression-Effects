["initializing"] Let's analyze the timeline step by step: ["end-section"]

1. **Waking Up**: Linda wakes up at 10 am.

2. **Elizabeth's Observation**: ["adding-knowledge"] Elizabeth saw Linda at the train station from 10 am to 12 pm. This means Linda was at the train station during this time. ["end-section"]

3. **David's Observation**: ["adding-knowledge"] David saw Linda at the office from 2 pm to 4 pm. ["end-section"]

4. **Sarah's Observation**: ["adding-knowledge"] Sarah saw Linda at the airport from 4 pm to 5 pm. ["end-section"]

5. **Ashley's Observation**: ["adding-knowledge"] Ashley saw Linda at school from 5 pm to 9 pm. ["end-section"]

6. **Betty's Observation**: ["adding-knowledge"] Betty saw Linda walking in the garden from 9 pm to 10 pm. ["end-section"]

7. **Beach Closing**: ["adding-knowledge"] The beach was closed after 10 pm. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Determining Possible Beach Times: ["end-section"]

- ["deduction"] From Elizabeth's observation, Linda was at the train station from 10 am to 12 pm. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] The beach was closed after 10 pm, so Linda couldn't have gone to the beach after 10 pm. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] David saw Linda at the office from 2 pm to 4 pm, which is a different location. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] Sarah saw Linda at the airport from 4 pm to 5 pm, which is also a different location. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] Ashley saw Linda at school from 5 pm to 9 pm, a different location. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] Betty saw Linda in the garden from 9 pm to 10 pm, which is just before the beach closes. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Conflict in Schedules: ["end-section"]

- ["deduction"] Linda was at the train station from 10 am to 12 pm. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] The beach was closed after 10 pm, so she couldn't have gone to the beach after 10 pm. ["end-section"]
- ["deduction"] However, she was at the garden from 9 pm to 10 pm, which is the latest time before the beach closes. ["end-section"]

["conclusion"] Conclusion: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Linda was at the garden from 9 pm to 10 pm, and the beach was closed after 10 pm. Therefore, she couldn't have gone to the beach after 10 pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] The only overlapping time when she wasn't observed at any location is between 12 pm and 2 pm. ["end-section"]

["conclusion"] Final Answer: \boxed{A} ["end-section"]
