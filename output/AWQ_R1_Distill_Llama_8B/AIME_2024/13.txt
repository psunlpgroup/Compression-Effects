Okay, so I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q and R when N is divided by 1000, and then compute Q + R.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if I change any single digit of N to 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, replacing that digit with 1 should give a multiple of 7.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should aim for the largest possible four-digit number satisfying this condition.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0.

The problem states that if I change any one of these digits to 1, the resulting number should be divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing B to 1 gives another number divisible by 7, and so on.

Therefore, for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 must result in a number that is a multiple of 7.

Let me formalize this:

1. Changing the first digit (A) to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. This number must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing the second digit (B) to 1: The number becomes A1CD. This number must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the third digit (C) to 1: The number becomes AB1D. This number must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the fourth digit (D) to 1: The number becomes ABC1. This number must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, it's likely that the digits A, B, C, D are as large as possible, but they must satisfy these divisibility conditions when any digit is replaced by 1.

So, I need to find the largest ABCD such that:

- 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7

- A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7

- AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7

- ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Since N is a four-digit number, A is at least 1.

Given that N is the largest such number, we can start by assuming that the digits A, B, C, D are as large as possible, but we have to verify the divisibility conditions.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we change the first digit to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing the second digit to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Changing the third digit: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Changing the fourth digit: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 10.

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7

Also, since N is the greatest such number, we can aim for N being as large as possible, so A, B, C, D should be as large as possible, with A ≥ 9 (but since N is four-digit, A can be 9 at maximum). But let's see.

But perhaps instead of trying to take the maximum digits, we can model the problem more algebraically.

Let me compute the numerical values modulo 7 for the four numbers above.

First, compute 1000 mod 7:

1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 ÷ 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, we can express each of the modified numbers modulo 7.

Let me write each condition in terms of A, B, C, D modulo 7.

1. Changing first digit to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (1).

2. Changing second digit to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Equation (2).

3. Changing third digit to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. Equation (3).

4. Changing fourth digit to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 10 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A + 2B + 3C + 3 ≡ 0 mod 7. Equation (4).

So, now we have four equations:

(1) 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, so 6 + ... ≡ -1 + ... ≡ 0 mod 7 implies ... ≡ 1 mod 7)

Wait, let me re-express Equation (1):

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, this can be written as:

-1 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 => 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7. So Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Similarly, Equation (2):

6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

6A ≡ -A mod 7, so:

- A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 => -A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7 => A - 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7. Equation (2): A - 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Equation (3):

6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

6A ≡ -A mod 7, so:

- A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 => -A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod 7 => A - 2B - D ≡ 3 mod 7. Equation (3): A - 2B - D ≡ 3 mod 7.

Equation (4):

6A + 2B + 3C + 3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

6A ≡ -A mod 7, so:

- A + 2B + 3C + 3 ≡ 0 mod 7 => -A + 2B + 3C ≡ -3 mod 7 => A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7. Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

So now, we have four equations:

(1) 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7.

(2) A - 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

(3) A - 2B - D ≡ 3 mod 7.

(4) A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D, each ranging from 0 to 9 (with A ≥ 1).

Our goal is to find the maximum N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, we want A, B, C, D as large as possible, but subject to these modular conditions.

Let me try to solve these equations step by step.

First, let me note that Equations (2), (3), and (4) all involve A, B, C, D, so perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me try to express D from Equation (1):

From (1): D ≡ 1 - 2B - 3C mod 7.

Similarly, from Equation (2): A - 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

But since D ≡ 1 - 2B - 3C mod 7, plug into Equation (2):

A - 3C - (1 - 2B - 3C) ≡ 2 mod 7.

Simplify:

A - 3C - 1 + 2B + 3C ≡ 2 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

A - 1 + 2B ≡ 2 mod 7 => A + 2B ≡ 3 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (2a).

Similarly, from Equation (3): A - 2B - D ≡ 3 mod 7.

Again, substitute D from Equation (1):

A - 2B - (1 - 2B - 3C) ≡ 3 mod 7.

Simplify:

A - 2B - 1 + 2B + 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

A - 1 + 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 => A + 3C ≡ 4 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (3a).

Similarly, from Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, now we have:

Equation (2a): A + 2B ≡ 3 mod 7.

Equation (3a): A + 3C ≡ 4 mod 7.

Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, three equations with variables A, B, C.

Let me try to solve Equations (2a), (3a), and (4).

From Equation (2a): A + 2B ≡ 3 mod 7.

From Equation (3a): A + 3C ≡ 4 mod 7.

From Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

Let me denote:

Equation (2a): A ≡ 3 - 2B mod 7.

Equation (3a): A ≡ 4 - 3C mod 7.

So, 3 - 2B ≡ 4 - 3C mod 7 => -2B + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, -2B + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (5).

Also, from Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

But from Equations (2a) and (3a):

A ≡ 3 - 2B mod 7.

And A ≡ 4 - 3C mod 7.

So, substituting A into Equation (4):

(3 - 2B) - 2B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 => 3 - 4B - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 => -4B - 3C ≡ 0 mod 7 => 4B + 3C ≡ 0 mod 7. Equation (6).

So now, we have Equations (5) and (6):

Equation (5): -2B + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

Equation (6): 4B + 3C ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me write Equations (5) and (6):

(5): -2B + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

(6): 4B + 3C ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me subtract Equation (5) from Equation (6):

(4B + 3C) - (-2B + 3C) ≡ 0 - 1 mod 7.

Simplify:

4B + 3C + 2B - 3C ≡ -1 mod 7.

So, 6B ≡ -1 mod 7 => 6B ≡ 6 mod 7 => Since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, 6B ≡ 6 mod 7 => B ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, B ≡ 1 mod 7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are B = 1 or B = 8.

But since we want the maximum N, we should try B as large as possible, so B = 8 first, then B = 1.

Let me first try B = 8.

If B = 8, then from Equation (5): -2*8 + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

Compute: -16 + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

-16 mod 7: 16 ÷ 7 is 2 with remainder 2, so -16 ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod 7.

So, 5 + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7 => 3C ≡ -4 ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 => C ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, C can be 1 or 8.

But again, we want the largest possible N, so C = 8.

So, C = 8.

Then, from Equation (3a): A + 3C ≡ 4 mod 7 => A + 3*8 ≡ 4 mod 7 => A + 24 ≡ 4 mod 7.

24 mod 7: 7*3=21, so 24 ≡ 3 mod 7.

Thus, A + 3 ≡ 4 mod 7 => A ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, A can be 1 or 8.

Since we want the largest N, we choose A = 8.

So, A = 8, B = 8, C = 8.

Then, from Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Compute 2*8 + 3*8 = 16 + 24 = 40. 40 mod 7: 7*5=35, 40-35=5. So, 5 + D ≡ 1 mod 7 => D ≡ -4 ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, D can be 3 or 10, but since D is a digit, D = 3.

So, tentative digits: A=8, B=8, C=8, D=3. So N = 8883.

But wait, let's check all four conditions to make sure.

First, change first digit to 1: 1 8 8 3. Is 1883 divisible by 7?

Compute 1883 ÷ 7: 7*268 = 1876, 1883 - 1876 = 7. So, 1883 = 7*269. So, yes, divisible by 7.

Second, change second digit to 1: 8 1 8 3. 8183 ÷ 7: 7*1168 = 8186, which is more than 8183. 7*1167=8179, so 8183 - 8179=4, not divisible. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, 8183 ÷ 7: Let me compute 7*1167=8179. 8183 - 8179=4. So, remainder 4. So, 8183 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, N=8883 doesn't satisfy the second condition.

Hmm, so my assumption was wrong.

So, B=8 and C=8 lead to N=8883, which fails the second condition.

Therefore, B=8 is invalid.

So, let me try B=1 instead.

So, B=1.

From Equation (5): -2*1 + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7 => -2 + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7 => 3C ≡ 3 mod 7 => C ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, C=1 or C=8.

Again, aiming for the largest N, try C=8.

So, C=8.

From Equation (3a): A + 3*8 ≡ 4 mod 7 => A + 24 ≡ 4 mod 7 => 24 mod7=3, so A +3≡4 mod7 => A≡1 mod7.

Thus, A=1 or A=8.

Again, to maximize N, try A=8.

So, A=8, B=1, C=8.

Then, from Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

2*1 +3*8= 2+24=26. 26 mod7: 7*3=21, 26-21=5. So, 5 + D ≡1 mod7 => D≡-4≡3 mod7.

Thus, D=3 or D=10, but D is a digit, so D=3.

So, N=8 1 8 3=8183.

But wait, we saw earlier that 8183 is not divisible by 7 when we change the second digit. Wait, actually, in this case, changing the second digit to 1 gives 8 1 8 3, which is 8183, which is not divisible by 7. So, this fails the second condition as well.

So, N=8183 is invalid.

Wait, so both B=8 and B=1 lead to N=8883 and N=8183, both of which fail the second condition. So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to go back and check my equations.

Wait, let me verify my equations again.

From Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): A - 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Equation (3): A - 2B - D ≡3 mod7.

Equation (4): A - 2B - 3C ≡3 mod7.

So, when I tried B=8, C=8, A=8, D=3, we saw that N=8883, but changing the second digit to 1 gives 8183, which isn't divisible by 7.

Wait, but according to Equation (2): A -3C - D ≡2 mod7.

With A=8, C=8, D=3: 8 -24 -3= -19 ≡ -19 mod7.

-19 ÷7 is -3*7=-21, so -19= -21 +2, so -19≡2 mod7. So, Equation (2) is satisfied.

Similarly, Equation (3): A -2B - D =8 -16 -3= -11≡-11 mod7. -11 +14=3, so -11≡3 mod7. So, Equation (3) is satisfied.

Equation (4): A -2B -3C=8 -16 -24= -32≡-32 mod7. -32 +35=3, so -32≡3 mod7. So, Equation (4) is satisfied.

So, all equations are satisfied, but when we actually compute the numbers, changing the second digit to 1 gives 8183, which is not divisible by 7.

Wait, so even though the equations are satisfied, the actual number may not be divisible by 7 because of carries or something?

Wait, no, because we derived the equations based on modulo 7, so if the equations are satisfied, the numbers should be divisible by 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute 8183 ÷7.

7*1000=7000, 8183-7000=1183.

7*100=700, 1183-700=483.

7*60=420, 483-420=63.

7*9=63. So, total is 1000 + 100 +60 +9=1169.

So, 7*1169=8183. So, actually, 8183 is divisible by7. So, why did I think earlier that 8183 ÷7 gives a remainder?

Wait, no, my mistake earlier. 8183 is divisible by7, as shown.

Wait, but when I computed 7*1167=8179, which is 8183-8179=4. So, 8183=7*1167 +4, which would mean 8183 is not divisible by7. But according to the above, 7*1169=8183, which is correct.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 7*1169.

Wait, 1169*7: 1000*7=7000, 100*7=700, 60*7=420, 9*7=63.

7000 +700=7700, 7700 +420=8120, 8120 +63=8183. So, correct.

So, 7*1169=8183, so 8183 is divisible by7.

Wait, so my initial thought that 8183 wasn't divisible by7 was wrong.

Wait, so N=8883: changing the second digit to1 gives 8183, which is divisible by7.

Similarly, changing the third digit to1: 8813.

Compute 8813 ÷7: 7*1258=8816, which is 3 more than 8813, so 8813=7*1258 -3, so 8813≡-3 mod7≡4 mod7, which is not 0. Wait, but according to Equation (3): A -2B -D=8 -16 -3= -11≡3 mod7. So, 3≡0 mod7? No, it's 3, not 0.

Wait, but Equation (3) was supposed to represent changing the third digit to1 and the number being divisible by7.

Wait, 8813 ÷7: 7*1258=8816, which is 3 more than 8813, so 8813 is not divisible by7. But according to Equation (3), 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Wait, let me compute 6A + 2B + 3 + D.

6*8 + 2*8 +3 +3=48 +16 +3 +3=70.

70 is divisible by7, so 70≡0 mod7.

So, 8813 should be divisible by7, but when I compute 8813 ÷7, it's 1258. So, wait, 1258*7=8816, which is 3 more than 8813, so 8813 is 1258*7 -3=8816-3=8813, which is not divisible by7.

But according to Equation (3), it should be divisible.

Wait, there's a contradiction here. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong?

Wait, let me re-examine the translation of the problem into equations.

When I change the third digit to1, the number becomes AB1D.

So, the number is 1000A + 100B +10*1 + D=1000A +100B +10 +D.

Modulo7, that's 6A +2B +3 + D.

But if 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7, then 6A +2B + D +3 ≡0 mod7, which is Equation (3): 6A +2B + D ≡ -3 mod7≡4 mod7.

But when I plug in A=8, B=8, D=3, then 6*8 +2*8 +3=48 +16 +3=67. 67 mod7: 7*9=63, 67-63=4. So, 67≡4 mod7, so 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7, so 6A +2B + D +3 ≡7≡0 mod7.

So, 1000A +100B +10 + D is divisible by7.

But when I compute 1000*8 +100*8 +10 +3=8000 +800 +10 +3=8813.

Wait, but 8813 ÷7=1258.714..., which is not an integer.

But according to the equation, it should be.

Wait, this is a contradiction. So, perhaps my initial equations are wrong.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Wait, the number after changing the third digit to1 is AB1D, which is 1000A + 100B +10 + D.

Similarly, changing the fourth digit to1 is ABC1, which is 1000A + 100B +10C +10.

But in the case of N=8883, ABC1 would be 8881.

Wait, 8881 ÷7: 7*1271=8887, which is more than 8881, so 7*1270=8880, so 8881-8880=1. So, 8881≡1 mod7. So, not divisible by7.

But according to Equation (4): 6A + 2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=8, B=8, C=8: 6*8 +2*8 +3*8 +3=48 +16 +24 +3=91. 91 mod7=0. So, 91≡0 mod7.

So, ABC1=8881, which is 91 mod7, which is 0, but 8881 mod7: 8881 -7*1270=8881 -8880=1≡1 mod7.

Wait, this is inconsistent.

Wait, so according to the equation, ABC1 should be divisible by7, but in reality, it's 8881, which is not.

Therefore, something's wrong with my equations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the modulo.

Wait, 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, when I change the fourth digit to1, the number is ABC1=1000A + 100B +10C +10.

So, modulo7, that is 6A +2B +3C +3.

So, if 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7, then ABC1 is divisible by7.

But when I plug in A=8, B=8, C=8: 6*8 +2*8 +3*8 +3=48 +16 +24 +3=91≡0 mod7. So, ABC1 should be divisible by7.

But 8881 ÷7: 1270*7=8880, so 8881=8880 +1≡1 mod7.

Wait, so 8881≡1 mod7, but according to the equation, it should be 0.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption that 1000 mod7=6 is wrong?

Wait, let me recalculate 1000 mod7.

7*142=994, 1000-994=6, so yes, 1000≡6 mod7.

100 mod7: 100 ÷7=14*7=98, 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, ABC1=6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

But in our case, 6*8 +2*8 +3*8 +3=48 +16 +24 +3=91≡0 mod7.

But 8881 ÷7: 8881-7*1270=8881-8880=1≡1 mod7. So, this is a contradiction.

Therefore, my equations are wrong.

Wait, maybe because 1000A mod7 is not 6A mod7, but 6*A mod7, but actually, 1000A mod7= (1000 mod7)*(A mod7)=6*A mod7.

Wait, but 1000A is 1000*A, not 1000 mod7 times A mod7. Wait, no, actually, 1000A mod7= (1000 mod7)*(A mod7) + carryover?

Wait, no, actually, modular arithmetic works such that (a*b) mod m = [(a mod m)*(b mod m)] mod m.

So, 1000A mod7= (6*A) mod7.

Similarly, 100B mod7=2*B mod7.

10C mod7=3*C mod7.

1 mod7=1.

Therefore, ABC1 mod7=6*A +2*B +3*C +1.

Wait, wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, ABC1 is 1000A +100B +10C +1.

So, mod7, it's (1000A mod7) + (100B mod7) + (10C mod7) + (1 mod7).

Which is (6A) + (2B) + (3C) +1.

So, 6A + 2B + 3C +1≡0 mod7.

But earlier, I thought it was 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

Wait, that was my mistake.

So, actually, Equation (4) should be:

6A +2B +3C +1≡0 mod7.

Similarly, let me check the other equations.

Changing the first digit to1: 1BCD=1000 +100B +10C + D.

Mod7: 6 +2B +3C + D≡0 mod7.

Which is Equation (1): 2B +3C + D≡1 mod7.

Changing the second digit to1: A1CD=1000A +100 +10C + D.

Mod7:6A +2 +3C + D≡0 mod7.

Equation (2):6A +3C + D≡-2 mod7≡5 mod7.

Wait, earlier I thought Equation (2) was A -3C - D≡2 mod7, but that was incorrect.

Wait, 6A +2 +3C + D≡0 mod7 =>6A +3C + D≡-2 mod7≡5 mod7.

So, Equation (2):6A +3C + D≡5 mod7.

Similarly, changing the third digit to1: AB1D=1000A +100B +10 + D.

Mod7:6A +2B +3 + D≡0 mod7.

Thus, Equation (3):6A +2B + D≡-3 mod7≡4 mod7.

Changing the fourth digit to1: ABC1=1000A +100B +10C +10.

Mod7:6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

So, correcting the equations:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3 ≡0 mod7.

So, now, with these corrected equations, let's try solving them again.

So, Equations:

(1):2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

(2):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

(3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

(4):6A +2B +3C +3 ≡0 mod7.

So, now, we have four equations.

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (1): D ≡1 -2B -3C mod7.

From Equation (2):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

But D ≡1 -2B -3C, so plug into Equation (2):

6A +3C +1 -2B -3C ≡5 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -2B +1 ≡5 mod7 =>6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Equation (2a).

Similarly, Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Again, D ≡1 -2B -3C, so plug in:

6A +2B +1 -2B -3C ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

6A +1 -3C ≡4 mod7 =>6A -3C ≡3 mod7. Equation (3a).

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3 ≡0 mod7.

So, Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡-3 mod7≡4 mod7.

So, now, Equations (2a), (3a), (4):

(2a):6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

(3a):6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

(4):6A +2B +3C ≡4 mod7.

Let me write Equations (2a) and (3a):

Equation (2a):6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Equation (3a):6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡4 mod7.

Let me try to express A in terms of B and C.

From Equation (2a):6A ≡4 +2B mod7 => A ≡(4 +2B)/6 mod7.

But 6 inverse mod7 is 6, since 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, A≡6*(4 +2B) mod7.

Compute 6*(4 +2B)=24 +12B≡24 mod7=3, 12B mod7=5B.

So, A≡3 +5B mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (3a):6A ≡3 +3C mod7 => A≡(3 +3C)/6 mod7.

Again, inverse of6 mod7 is6.

So, A≡6*(3 +3C) mod7=18 +18C≡18 mod7=4, 18C mod7=4C.

Thus, A≡4 +4C mod7.

So, now, from Equations (2a) and (3a), we have:

From (2a): A≡3 +5B mod7.

From (3a): A≡4 +4C mod7.

Therefore, 3 +5B ≡4 +4C mod7 =>5B -4C ≡1 mod7. Equation (5).

Also, from Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡4 mod7.

But from Equations (2a) and (3a):

6A ≡4 +2B from (2a).

Wait, no, from Equation (2a):6A≡4 +2B mod7.

From Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡4 mod7.

Substitute 6A≡4 +2B:

(4 +2B) +2B +3C ≡4 mod7 =>4 +4B +3C ≡4 mod7 =>4B +3C≡0 mod7. Equation (6).

So, Equations (5) and (6):

(5):5B -4C ≡1 mod7.

(6):4B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Let me solve Equations (5) and (6):

Equation (5):5B -4C ≡1 mod7.

Equation (6):4B +3C ≡0 mod7.

Let me solve this system.

Let me write Equation (5):5B -4C =1 +7k.

Equation (6):4B +3C=0 +7m.

Let me solve for B and C.

Let me try to express C from Equation (6):

From Equation (6):3C= -4B +7m => C=(-4B)/3 + (7m)/3.

But since C must be integer, (-4B)/3 must be integer, so 3 divides 4B.

So, 4B≡0 mod3 => B≡0 mod3, since 4 and3 are coprime.

Thus, B=0,3,6,9.

But since B is a digit, B=0,3,6,9.

Let me check each possible B:

Case 1: B=0.

From Equation (6):4*0 +3C=0 +7m =>3C=7m =>C= (7m)/3.

So, C must be integer, so m must be multiple of3.

Let m=3k.

Then, C=7k.

But C is a digit, so C=0,7.

If C=0:

From Equation (5):5*0 -4*0=0≡1 mod7? No, 0≡1 mod7? No.

If C=7:

From Equation (5):5*0 -4*7= -28≡ -28 mod7=0≡1 mod7? No.

So, B=0 invalid.

Case2: B=3.

From Equation (6):4*3 +3C=12 +3C≡0 mod7.

12 mod7=5, so 5 +3C≡0 mod7 =>3C≡-5≡2 mod7.

So, 3C≡2 mod7 =>C≡(2*3^{-1}) mod7.

3 inverse mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C≡2*5=10≡3 mod7.

So, C=3 or C=10, but C is a digit, so C=3.

So, C=3.

From Equation (5):5*3 -4*3=15 -12=3≡1 mod7? No, 3≡1 mod7? No.

So, 3≡1 mod7 is false, so invalid.

Case3: B=6.

From Equation (6):4*6 +3C=24 +3C≡0 mod7.

24 mod7=3, so 3 +3C≡0 mod7 =>3C≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, 3C≡4 mod7 =>C≡(4*3^{-1}) mod7=4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, C=6.

From Equation (5):5*6 -4*6=30 -24=6≡1 mod7? 6≡1 mod7? No.

So, invalid.

Case4: B=9.

From Equation (6):4*9 +3C=36 +3C≡0 mod7.

36 mod7=1, so 1 +3C≡0 mod7 =>3C≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, 3C≡6 mod7 =>C≡6*3^{-1} mod7=6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So, C=2.

From Equation (5):5*9 -4*2=45 -8=37≡37 mod7=2 mod7. 2≡1 mod7? No.

So, invalid.

Thus, none of the cases for B=0,3,6,9 with C as integer digit satisfy Equation (5). So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to allow C to be larger, but since C is a digit, maximum C=9.

Wait, but in each case, C is restricted.

Wait, maybe instead of solving Equations (5) and (6) together, I can express one variable in terms of another.

From Equation (6):4B +3C≡0 mod7.

Express C in terms of B: 3C≡-4B mod7 => C≡(-4B)/3 mod7.

Since 3 inverse is5 mod7, so C≡(-4B)*5 mod7= (-20B) mod7= (-20 mod7)*B mod7.

-20 mod7: 20 ÷7=2*7=14, 20-14=6, so -20≡-6≡1 mod7.

So, C≡1*B mod7 => C≡B mod7.

So, C=B mod7.

Therefore, C=B +7k, where k is integer, but since C and B are digits, C=B or C=B+7, but since C≤9, if B≥3, C=B+7 would exceed 9.

So, if C=B or C=B+7.

But since C and B are digits, C=B or C=B+7, but C≤9.

So, for each B, C can be B or B+7, but only if B+7≤9.

Thus, C=B or C=B+7 (if B≤2).

So, C=B or C=B+7.

So, let's note that.

So, C=B or C=B+7.

So, let's use this in Equation (5):5B -4C≡1 mod7.

But since C=B or C=B+7, let's substitute.

Case1: C=B.

Then, Equation (5):5B -4B= B≡1 mod7 => B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

Case2: C=B+7.

Then, Equation (5):5B -4*(B+7)=5B -4B -28≡B -28≡1 mod7.

But -28 mod7=0, so B≡1 mod7.

So, same as above, B=1 or8.

So, in both cases, B≡1 mod7, so B=1 or8.

Thus, possible B=1 or8.

So, let's consider B=1 first.

Case1: B=1.

Then, C=B or C=B+7.

So, C=1 or C=8.

First, C=1.

From Equation (6):4*1 +3*1=4 +3=7≡0 mod7. So, okay.

From Equation (5):5*1 -4*1=5 -4=1≡1 mod7. So, satisfies Equation (5).

So, C=1, B=1.

Then, from Equation (2a):6A -2B≡4 mod7 =>6A -2≡4 mod7 =>6A≡6 mod7 =>A≡1 mod7.

So, A=1 or8.

From Equation (3a):6A -3C≡3 mod7.

With A=1, C=1:6*1 -3*1=6 -3=3≡3 mod7. Satisfied.

With A=8, C=1:6*8 -3*1=48 -3=45≡45 mod7. 45 ÷7=6*7=42, 45-42=3≡3 mod7. Also satisfied.

So, A=1 or8.

From Equation (1):2B +3C +D≡1 mod7 =>2*1 +3*1 +D=2 +3 +D=5 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, D=3 or10, but D is a digit, so D=3.

So, with A=1, B=1, C=1, D=3.

Thus, N=1113.

But we need the greatest N, so let's check if A=8 is possible.

A=8, B=1, C=1, D=3.

So, N=8113.

Check if all four conditions are satisfied.

Changing first digit to1: 1113. 1113 ÷7: 7*159=1113. So, yes, divisible.

Changing second digit to1:8113. 8113 ÷7: 7*1159=8113. So, yes.

Changing third digit to1:8113, same as above.

Wait, actually, changing the third digit to1:8113, same number.

Wait, no, if N=8113, changing the third digit to1 gives 81 1 3=8113, which is the same number. So, it's trivially divisible.

Similarly, changing the fourth digit to1:8111. 8111 ÷7: 7*1158=8110, 8111-8110=1≡1 mod7. Not divisible.

Wait, so N=8113 fails the fourth condition.

But according to Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=8, B=1, C=1:6*8 +2*1 +3*1 +3=48 +2 +3 +3=56≡0 mod7. So, equation is satisfied.

But 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., which is not an integer.

So, contradiction.

Wait, so N=8113 fails the fourth condition, even though Equation (4) is satisfied.

Wait, this is because when we change the fourth digit to1, the number becomes ABC1, which is 8111.

But according to Equation (4), 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7, which is satisfied, but 8111 is not divisible by7.

Wait, so again, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we change the fourth digit to1, it's ABC1, which is 1000A +100B +10C +10.

Modulo7, that's 6A +2B +3C +3.

Which is 6*8 +2*1 +3*1 +3=48 +2 +3 +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, ABC1 should be divisible by7.

But 8111 ÷7: 8111=7*1158 +3, which is not divisible.

Wait, so ABC1 is 8111, which is 3 mod7, but Equation (4) says it's 0 mod7. So, conflict.

Wait, so even though the equation is satisfied, the actual number is not divisible by7.

So, perhaps my equations are incomplete or incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the modulo.

Wait, 1000A mod7=6A, 100B mod7=2B, 10C mod7=3C, 10 mod7=3.

So, ABC1=6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

So, 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

Which is Equation (4).

But when we plug in A=8, B=1, C=1:6*8 +2*1 +3*1 +3=48 +2 +3 +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, ABC1 should be divisible by7.

But 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., which is not integer.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated 8111 ÷7.

Let me compute 7*1158=8110.

So, 8111=8110 +1=7*1158 +1≡1 mod7.

But according to Equation (4), 6A +2B +3C +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, 8111≡1 mod7, but Equation (4) says it should be 0. So, conflict.

Therefore, the equations are correct, but the actual number is not divisible by7.

Wait, this can only mean that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the way I represented the number is wrong.

Wait, ABC1 is 1000A +100B +10C +10.

But 1000A +100B +10C +10.

So, in terms of modulo7:

(1000A mod7) + (100B mod7) + (10C mod7) + (10 mod7)=6A +2B +3C +3.

So, yes, correct.

So, 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

Which is Equation (4).

But 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., which is 1 mod7.

But 6A +2B +3C +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, ABC1 should be divisible by7, but it is not.

Wait, this is a paradox.

Alternatively, perhaps the number ABC1 is different.

Wait, N=8113, changing the fourth digit to1 gives 8111.

But N is 8113, which is 8113.

Wait, 8113 ÷7=1159. So, 7*1159=8113.

Yes, 1159*7=8113.

So, 8113 is divisible by7.

But changing the fourth digit to1 gives 8111, which is different.

But why is 8111 not divisible by7?

Wait, 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., which is not integer.

But 8113 ÷7=1159, so 8111=8113 -2, so 8111=7*1158 + (7 -2)=7*1158 +5≡5 mod7.

So, 8111≡5 mod7, but Equation (4) says it should be 0.

Wait, but Equation (4) is about N=8113.

Wait, no, Equation (4) is about changing the fourth digit to1, which is 8111.

But 8111≡5 mod7, which is not 0, but Equation (4) says it should be 0.

Therefore, my equations are wrong.

Wait, perhaps the error is in how I model the numbers.

Wait, when I change the fourth digit to1, the number becomes ABC1, which is 1000A + 100B +10C +10.

So, N=1000A +100B +10C + D.

Changing D to1 gives ABC1=1000A +100B +10C +10.

So, the difference between ABC1 and N is 10 - D.

But I thought that since N=1000A +100B +10C + D, then ABC1=1000A +100B +10C +10.

But actually, 1000A +100B +10C + D is N.

So, ABC1 is N - D +10.

So, ABC1= N - D +10.

Therefore, if N is divisible by7, then ABC1= N - D +10.

So, if N is divisible by7, ABC1 ≡0 - D +3 mod7.

Because 10≡3 mod7.

So, ABC1≡ -D +3 mod7.

But according to the problem, ABC1 must be divisible by7, so ABC1≡0 mod7.

Therefore, -D +3≡0 mod7 => D≡3 mod7.

Which is consistent with Equation (1):2B +3C + D≡1 mod7.

So, D≡1 -2B -3C mod7.

But D also must be≡3 mod7.

Thus, 1 -2B -3C≡3 mod7 => -2B -3C≡2 mod7 =>2B +3C≡-2≡5 mod7.

Which is Equation (1):2B +3C + D≡1 mod7 =>2B +3C≡1 - D mod7.

But D≡3 mod7, so 2B +3C≡1 -3≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, consistent.

But the problem is that when I set N=8113, which is divisible by7, ABC1=8111 is not.

But according to Equation (4), ABC1 should be divisible by7.

Wait, but 8111 is not.

Wait, is there a problem with the way I compute the modulo?

Wait, 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., so 8111≡5 mod7.

But Equation (4) says it should be 0.

So, there must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 6A +2B +3C +3.

With A=8, B=1, C=1:6*8 +2*1 +3*1 +3=48 +2 +3 +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, 56 is divisible by7, so ABC1 should be divisible by7.

But 8111 is not.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing N with ABC1.

Wait, N=8113, ABC1=8111.

But 8113 ÷7=1159.

So, 8113 is divisible by7.

But 8111 is not.

So, the problem is that ABC1 is not equal to N.

Wait, but ABC1 is a different number, derived from N.

So, perhaps my initial equations are correct, but the issue is that N is divisible by7, but ABC1 is not.

But according to the problem, changing any digit to1 should result in a number divisible by7.

So, in particular, changing the fourth digit to1, which gives ABC1, must be divisible by7.

But in our case, ABC1=8111 is not.

So, this means that my assumption that N=8113 is invalid, even though it satisfies all four conditions.

Therefore, I must have gone wrong in my equations.

Wait, perhaps because when changing the fourth digit to1, the number is ABC1, which is N - D +10.

Therefore, if N is divisible by7, ABC1= N - D +10.

Therefore, if ABC1 is divisible by7, then N - D +10 ≡0 mod7.

But since N≡0 mod7, then -D +10≡0 mod7 => D≡10 mod7≡3 mod7.

Which is consistent with Equation (1): D≡3 mod7.

But in our case, N=8113 is divisible by7, D=3≡3 mod7, so ABC1=8113 -3 +10=8120.

Wait, 8120 ÷7: 7*1160=8120, so yes, 8120 is divisible by7.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, ABC1 is 1000A +100B +10C +10.

So, for N=8113, ABC1=8111.

But 8111 is not divisible by7, but according to the equation, ABC1 should be N - D +10=8113 -3 +10=8120, which is divisible by7.

Wait, so which one is it?

Wait, is ABC1= N - D +10 or 1000A +100B +10C +10?

Wait, N=1000A +100B +10C + D.

So, changing the fourth digit to1: ABC1=1000A +100B +10C +10.

Which is N - D +10.

So, ABC1= N - D +10.

But in our case, N=8113, so ABC1=8113 -3 +10=8120.

Which is divisible by7.

But wait, 8120 is a different number from 8111.

Wait, this is the confusion.

So, when I change the fourth digit to1, I get ABC1=8120, not 8111.

Wait, so that was my mistake earlier.

So, ABC1 is not 8111, but 8120.

Wait, so N=8113, changing the fourth digit to1, we get 8120, which is divisible by7.

Similarly, changing the third digit to1:8113 becomes 8113 with C=1, which is same as N.

Wait, no, changing the third digit to1: AB1D=8113 becomes 81 1 3=8113, same as N.

Wait, no, wait, changing the third digit from3 to1: N=8113, changing third digit: 8113 becomes 8113? No, wait.

Wait, N=8113, changing the third digit to1: A B 1 D=8 1 1 3=8113.

So, same number.

Therefore, same number is divisible by7, so that's okay.

Similarly, changing the second digit: A1CD=8 1 1 3=8113, same number.

So, same number, which is divisible by7.

Similarly, changing the first digit to1:1 1 1 3=1113, which is divisible by7.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought changing the second digit to1 gives 8183, but actually, if N=8113, changing the second digit to1 gives 8113, which is same number.

Wait, so wait, is N=8113 such that changing any digit to1 gives 8113 or 8120.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's clarify:

N=8113.

Changing first digit:1 1 1 3=1113.

Changing second digit:8 1 1 3=8113.

Changing third digit:8 1 1 3=8113.

Changing fourth digit:8 1 1 1=8121.

Wait, no, 8121.

Wait, 8121 ÷7: 7*1160=8120, so 8121=8120 +1≡1 mod7.

So, 8121 is not divisible by7.

Wait, but according to Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=8, B=1, C=1:6*8 +2*1 +3*1 +3=48 +2 +3 +3=56≡0 mod7.

So, ABC1=8121 should be divisible by7, but 8121 ÷7=1160.142..., which is not.

So, conflict.

Wait, so changing the fourth digit to1 gives 8121, which is not divisible by7.

But Equation (4) is satisfied.

Wait, so the problem is that in reality, changing the fourth digit to1 gives 8121, which is not divisible by7, but according to Equation (4), it should be.

So, contradiction.

Therefore, my equations are correct but the actual number is not satisfying the condition.

Therefore, N=8113 is invalid.

Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption that A=8 is wrong.

Wait, so perhaps A cannot be8.

Wait, let me try A=7.

Wait, let's try A=7.

So, A=7.

From Equation (2a):6*7 -2B≡4 mod7 =>42 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-38≡-38+42=4 mod7=> -2B≡4 mod7=>2B≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, 2B≡3 mod7 =>B≡5 mod7.

So, B=5 or12, but B is a digit, so B=5.

So, B=5.

From Equation (3a):6*7 -3C≡3 mod7 =>42 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-39≡-39+42=3 mod7 => -3C≡3 mod7 =>3C≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, 3C≡4 mod7 =>C≡4*3^{-1}≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, C=6.

From Equation (1):2B +3C +D≡1 mod7 =>2*5 +3*6 +D=10 +18 +D=28 +D≡0 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

From Equation (2):6A +3C +D≡5 mod7 =>6*7 +3*6 +D=42 +18 +D=60 +D≡4 +D≡5 mod7 =>D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

So, D=1 or8.

So, with A=7, B=5, C=6, D=1 or8.

So, possible N=7561 or7568.

Now, check N=7561.

Changing first digit to1:1651. 1651 ÷7: 7*235=1645, 1651-1645=6≡6 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

N=7568.

Changing first digit to1:1658. 1658 ÷7:7*236=1652, 1658-1652=6≡6 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Thus, A=7 doesn't give a valid N.

Wait, maybe A=1.

Wait, A=1.

From Equation (2a):6*1 -2B≡4 mod7 =>6 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-2≡5 mod7 =>2B≡-5≡2 mod7 =>B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

From Equation (3a):6*1 -3C≡3 mod7 =>6 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-3≡4 mod7 =>3C≡-4≡3 mod7 =>C≡1 mod7.

So, C=1 or8.

From Equation (1):2B +3C +D≡1 mod7.

So, let's try B=1, C=1.

Then, 2*1 +3*1 +D=2 +3 +D=5 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, D=3 or10, but D is a digit, so D=3.

Thus, N=1113.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Changing first digit:1113, which is 1113 ÷7=159, so yes.

Changing second digit:1113, same number, yes.

Changing third digit:1113, same number, yes.

Changing fourth digit:1111. 1111 ÷7=158.714..., so no.

So, invalid.

Similarly, try B=8.

With A=1, B=8, C=1 or8.

First, C=1.

From Equation (1):2*8 +3*1 +D=16 +3 +D=19 +D≡5 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, D=3.

Thus, N=1 8 1 3=8183.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:1 8 1 3=1813. 1813 ÷7=259, yes.

Changing second digit:1 1 1 3=1113. 1113 ÷7=159, yes.

Changing third digit:1 8 1 3=8183, same number, yes.

Changing fourth digit:1 8 1 1=8111. 8111 ÷7=1158.714..., no.

So, invalid.

Next, C=8.

So, C=8.

From Equation (1):2*8 +3*8 +D=16 +24 +D=40 +D≡5 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-4≡3 mod7.

So, D=3.

Thus, N=1 8 8 3=8883.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:1 8 8 3=1883. 1883 ÷7=269, yes.

Changing second digit:1 1 8 3=1183. 1183 ÷7=169, yes.

Changing third digit:1 8 1 3=1813. 1813 ÷7=259, yes.

Changing fourth digit:1 8 8 1=8881. 8881 ÷7=1270.142..., no.

So, invalid.

Thus, A=1 also doesn't give a valid N.

Hmm, maybe A=2.

Wait, let's try A=2.

From Equation (2a):6*2 -2B≡4 mod7 =>12 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-8≡-8+14=6 mod7 =>2B≡-6≡1 mod7 =>B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11, but B is a digit, so B=4.

From Equation (3a):6*2 -3C≡3 mod7 =>12 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-9≡-9+14=5 mod7 =>3C≡-5≡2 mod7 =>C≡(2)/3 mod7=2*5=10≡3 mod7.

So, C=3.

From Equation (1):2*4 +3*3 +D=8 +9 +D=17 +D≡3 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, D=5.

Thus, N=2 4 3 5=2435.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:1 4 3 5=1435. 1435 ÷7=205, yes.

Changing second digit:2 1 3 5=2135. 2135 ÷7=305, yes.

Changing third digit:2 4 1 5=2415. 2415 ÷7=345, yes.

Changing fourth digit:2 4 3 1=2431. 2431 ÷7=347, yes.

So, N=2435 satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, that's a valid number.

But is it the greatest?

Wait, 2435 is a four-digit number, but is there a larger N?

Wait, maybe with A=2, but higher B, C, D.

Wait, but according to our earlier solving, N=2435 is the only solution for A=2.

But wait, let's check.

From A=2, B=4, C=3, D=5.

But wait, D=5≡5 mod7.

So, 2435 is the number.

But 2435 is less than 8883, which we tried earlier but failed.

But is there a larger N?

Wait, maybe I need to check A=3.

Let me try A=3.

From Equation (2a):6*3 -2B≡4 mod7 =>18 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-14≡0 mod7 =>2B≡0 mod7 =>B≡0 mod7.

So, B=0 or7.

From Equation (3a):6*3 -3C≡3 mod7 =>18 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-15≡-15+21=6 mod7 =>3C≡-6≡1 mod7 =>C≡1/3≡5 mod7.

So, C=5.

From Equation (1):2B +3C +D≡1 mod7.

So, B=0 or7.

First, B=0.

Then, 2*0 +3*5 +D=0 +15 +D=15 +D≡1 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

Thus, N=3 0 5 0=3050 or3057.

Check N=3050.

Changing first digit:13050? Wait, no, changing first digit of 3050 to1:1 0 5 0=1050. 1050 ÷7=150, yes.

Changing second digit:3 1 5 0=3150. 3150 ÷7=450, yes.

Changing third digit:3 0 1 0=3010. 3010 ÷7=430, yes.

Changing fourth digit:3 0 5 1=3051. 3051 ÷7=437.285..., no.

So, invalid.

N=3057.

Changing first digit:13057? No, changing first digit:1 0 5 7=1057. 1057 ÷7=151, yes.

Changing second digit:3 1 5 7=3157. 3157 ÷7=451, yes.

Changing third digit:3 0 1 7=3017. 3017 ÷7=431, yes.

Changing fourth digit:3 0 5 1=3051. 3051 ÷7=437.285..., no.

So, invalid.

Next, B=7.

So, B=7.

From Equation (1):2*7 +3*5 +D=14 +15 +D=29 +D≡1 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

Thus, N=3 7 5 0=3750 or3757.

Check N=3750.

Changing first digit:13750? No, 1 7 5 0=1750. 1750 ÷7=250, yes.

Changing second digit:3 1 5 0=3150. 3150 ÷7=450, yes.

Changing third digit:3 7 1 0=3710. 3710 ÷7=530, yes.

Changing fourth digit:3 7 5 1=3751. 3751 ÷7=535.857..., no.

So, invalid.

N=3757.

Changing first digit:13757? No, 1 7 5 7=1757. 1757 ÷7=251, yes.

Changing second digit:3 1 5 7=3157. 3157 ÷7=451, yes.

Changing third digit:3 7 1 7=3717. 3717 ÷7=531, yes.

Changing fourth digit:3 7 5 1=3751. 3751 ÷7=535.857..., no.

So, invalid.

Thus, A=3 also doesn't give a valid N.

Wait, so N=2435 is a valid number.

But is there a higher N?

Wait, let me try A=4.

From Equation (2a):6*4 -2B≡4 mod7 =>24 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-20≡-20+21=1 mod7 =>2B≡-1≡6 mod7 =>B≡3 mod7.

So, B=3 or10, but B is a digit, so B=3.

From Equation (3a):6*4 -3C≡3 mod7 =>24 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-21≡0 mod7 =>3C≡0 mod7 =>C≡0 mod7.

So, C=0 or7.

From Equation (1):2*3 +3C +D=6 +3C +D≡1 +C +D≡1 mod7.

So, 1 +C +D≡1 mod7 =>C +D≡0 mod7.

So, C=0 or7, D= -C mod7.

If C=0, D=0.

If C=7, D=7.

So, N=4 3 0 0=4300 or4 3 7 7=4377.

Check N=4300.

Changing first digit:14300? No, 1 3 0 0=1300. 1300 ÷7=185.714..., no.

Invalid.

N=4377.

Changing first digit:14377? No, 1 3 7 7=1377. 1377 ÷7=196.714..., no.

Invalid.

So, A=4 gives invalid N.

Similarly, A=5.

From Equation (2a):6*5 -2B≡4 mod7 =>30 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-26≡-26+28=2 mod7 =>2B≡-2≡5 mod7 =>B≡6 mod7.

So, B=6.

From Equation (3a):6*5 -3C≡3 mod7 =>30 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-27≡-27+28=1 mod7 =>3C≡-1≡6 mod7 =>C≡6*3^{-1}=6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So, C=2.

From Equation (1):2*6 +3*2 +D=12 +6 +D=18 +D≡4 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, D=4.

Thus, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:16524? No, 1 6 2 4=1624. 1624 ÷7=232, yes.

Changing second digit:5 1 2 4=5124. 5124 ÷7=732, yes.

Changing third digit:5 6 1 4=5614. 5614 ÷7=802, yes.

Changing fourth digit:5 6 2 1=5621. 5621 ÷7=803. So, 7*803=5621, yes.

So, N=5624 satisfies all four conditions.

But is this the greatest?

Wait, 5624 is higher than 2435.

But let's try higher A.

A=6.

From Equation (2a):6*6 -2B≡4 mod7 =>36 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-32≡-32+35=3 mod7 =>2B≡-3≡4 mod7 =>B≡2 mod7.

So, B=2 or9.

From Equation (3a):6*6 -3C≡3 mod7 =>36 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-33≡-33+35=2 mod7 =>3C≡-2≡5 mod7 =>C≡5*3^{-1}=5*5=25≡4 mod7.

So, C=4.

From Equation (1):2B +3C +D≡1 mod7.

So, B=2 or9.

First, B=2.

Then, 2*2 +3*4 +D=4 +12 +D=16 +D≡2 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, D=6.

Thus, N=6 2 4 6=6246.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:16246? No, 1 2 4 6=1246. 1246 ÷7=178, yes.

Changing second digit:6 1 4 6=6146. 6146 ÷7=878, yes.

Changing third digit:6 2 1 6=6216. 6216 ÷7=888, yes.

Changing fourth digit:6 2 4 1=6241. 6241 ÷7=891.571..., no.

So, invalid.

Next, B=9.

So, B=9.

From Equation (1):2*9 +3*4 +D=18 +12 +D=30 +D≡2 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, D=6.

Thus, N=6 9 4 6=6946.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:16946? No, 1 9 4 6=1946. 1946 ÷7=278, yes.

Changing second digit:6 1 4 6=6146. 6146 ÷7=878, yes.

Changing third digit:6 9 1 6=6916. 6916 ÷7=988, yes.

Changing fourth digit:6 9 4 1=6941. 6941 ÷7=991.571..., no.

So, invalid.

Thus, A=6 gives invalid N.

A=7.

Wait, tried earlier, didn't work.

A=8.

Wait, tried earlier, didn't work.

A=9.

From Equation (2a):6*9 -2B≡4 mod7 =>54 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-50≡-50+56=6 mod7 =>2B≡-6≡1 mod7 =>B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11, but B is a digit, so B=4.

From Equation (3a):6*9 -3C≡3 mod7 =>54 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-51≡-51+56=5 mod7 =>3C≡-5≡2 mod7 =>C≡2*3^{-1}=2*5=10≡3 mod7.

So, C=3.

From Equation (1):2*4 +3*3 +D=8 +9 +D=17 +D≡3 +D≡1 mod7 =>D≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, D=5.

Thus, N=9 4 3 5=9435.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:19435? No, 1 9 4 3=1943. 1943 ÷7=277, yes.

Changing second digit:9 1 3 5=9135. 9135 ÷7=1305, yes.

Changing third digit:9 4 1 5=9415. 9415 ÷7=1345, yes.

Changing fourth digit:9 4 3 1=9431. 9431 ÷7=1347.285..., no.

So, invalid.

Thus, N=9435 fails the fourth condition.

Wait, but according to Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=9, B=4, C=3:6*9 +2*4 +3*3 +3=54 +8 +9 +3=74≡74-70=4 mod7≡4≠0.

So, Equation (4) not satisfied.

Wait, but according to our solving, Equation (4) should be satisfied.

Wait, no, Equation (4) is 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

But with A=9, B=4, C=3:6*9=54≡54-49=5, 2*4=8≡1, 3*3=9≡2, 3≡3.

So, total:5 +1 +2 +3=11≡4 mod7≠0.

So, Equation (4) not satisfied, which is a problem.

But according to our solving process, Equation (4) should be satisfied.

Wait, so my solving process may have an error.

Wait, in Equation (4):6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=9, B=4, C=3:54 +8 +9 +3=74≡4 mod7≠0.

So, not satisfied.

So, contradiction.

Therefore, N=9435 is invalid.

Wait, so perhaps no solution exists for A=9.

Thus, among all possibilities, the highest N that satisfies all four conditions is N=5624.

Wait, but let me check A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4: N=5624.

Changing first digit:1624. 1624 ÷7=232, yes.

Changing second digit:5124. 5124 ÷7=732, yes.

Changing third digit:5614. 5614 ÷7=802, yes.

Changing fourth digit:5621. 5621 ÷7=803, yes.

So, N=5624 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher N?

Wait, what about N=6946? Wait, but changing fourth digit gives 6941, which is not divisible by7.

Wait, but earlier, N=5624 is valid.

Is there a higher N?

Wait, what about N=7561? It was invalid because changing first digit gave 1651, not divisible by7.

Wait, but let me check N=7561.

Wait, 7561 ÷7=1079.571..., which is not an integer.

So, N=7561 is invalid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

But wait, is there a higher N with A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

But maybe with higher digits.

Wait, let me check if N=6946 is valid.

Wait, N=6946.

Changing first digit:1 9 4 6=1946. 1946 ÷7=278, yes.

Changing second digit:6 1 4 6=6146. 6146 ÷7=878, yes.

Changing third digit:6 9 1 6=6916. 6916 ÷7=988, yes.

Changing fourth digit:6 9 4 1=6941. 6941 ÷7=991.571..., no.

So, invalid.

So, N=5624 is the maximum.

But wait, N=5624 is less than 8883, but 8883 was invalid.

Wait, perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the greatest four-digit positive integer".

So, N=5624 is the greatest.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N.

Wait, is N=6946 invalid, but N=8120 is invalid as well.

Wait, another approach: maybe N=8120 is invalid, but what about N=8121.

Wait, 8121 ÷7=1160.142..., which is not integer.

Wait, maybe N=8163.

Wait, 8163 ÷7=1167, which is integer.

But let me check the conditions.

Changing first digit:1 1 6 3=1163. 1163 ÷7=166.142..., no.

So, invalid.

Wait, so perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

But wait, I think I might have missed a higher N.

Wait, another way: since N=5624 works, and higher N=6946 doesn't, maybe N=5624 is the maximum.

But wait, another idea: maybe N=8120 is a multiple of7, but changing digits gives invalid numbers.

Wait, N=8120: changing first digit:12120? No, changing first digit to1:1 2 1 0=1210. 1210 ÷7=173.142..., no.

So, invalid.

Wait, perhaps N=8163.

But changing first digit:1 6 1 3=1613. 1613 ÷7=230.428..., no.

Invalid.

Wait, another way: perhaps I can use the equations to find a higher N.

Wait, N=5624 is a solution, but maybe a higher N exists.

Wait, let me try A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

Is there a way to increase any digit without violating the conditions?

Wait, if I set D=4, can I set D=11? No, D is a digit.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, maybe increasing C=2 to3, but then D would change.

Wait, but in the equations, C=2 is fixed.

Wait, let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can try A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4 is the only solution for A=5.

So, N=5624 is the maximum.

But wait, wait.

Wait, when A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

But if I can set C=9, but according to the equations, C=2.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, no, according to Equation (3a):6A -3C≡3 mod7.

With A=5:6*5 -3C≡3 mod7 =>30 -3C≡3 mod7 =>-3C≡-27≡-27+28=1 mod7 =>3C≡-1≡6 mod7 =>C≡2 mod7.

So, C=2 or9.

So, C=2 or9.

So, if C=9, what happens?

From Equation (1):2B +3*9 +D≡1 mod7 =>2B +27 +D≡1 mod7 =>2B +D≡-26≡-26+28=2 mod7.

From Equation (2a):6A -2B≡4 mod7 =>30 -2B≡4 mod7 =>-2B≡-26≡2 mod7 =>2B≡-2≡5 mod7 =>B≡6 mod7.

So, B=6 or13, but B is a digit, so B=6.

From Equation (1):2*6 +D≡2 mod7 =>12 +D≡2 mod7 =>D≡-10≡-10+14=4 mod7.

So, D=4.

Thus, N=5 6 9 4=5694.

Check changing digits:

Changing first digit:1 6 9 4=1694. 1694 ÷7=242.285..., no.

So, invalid.

Thus, C=9 is invalid.

Therefore, only N=5624 and N=5694.

But N=5694 fails first condition.

Thus, N=5624 is the only solution for A=5.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, but wait.

Wait, N=5624.

Changing first digit:1624 ÷7=232, yes.

Changing second digit:5124 ÷7=732, yes.

Changing third digit:5614 ÷7=802, yes.

Changing fourth digit:5621 ÷7=803, yes.

So, all conditions satisfied.

Is there a higher N?

Wait, let me check N=6946.

Wait, changing the fourth digit to1 gives 6941, which is not divisible by7.

But according to Equation (4), 6A +2B +3C +3≡0 mod7.

With A=6, B=9, C=4:6*6 +2*9 +3*4 +3=36 +18 +12 +3=69≡69-63=6 mod7≡6≠0.

So, Equation (4) not satisfied.

Thus, N=6946 invalid.

Thus, N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, but wait, 5624 is less than 8883, but 8883 fails some conditions.

Wait, but is there a number between 5624 and8883 that satisfies all conditions?

Wait, perhaps N=6946 is invalid, but let me try N=7561.

Wait, N=7561.

Changing first digit:1651 ÷7=235.857..., no.

So, invalid.

Wait, N=8163.

Changing first digit:1 6 1 3=1613 ÷7=230.428..., no.

So, invalid.

Wait, N=8120.

Changing first digit:12120? No, changing first digit:1 2 1 0=1210 ÷7=173.142..., no.

Invalid.

Wait, N=8163: Changing first digit:1 6 1 3=1613 ÷7=230.428..., no.

Thus, N=5624 seems to be the maximum.

Wait, but 5624 is only 5xxx, but 8883 is 8xxx.

But 8883 is invalid because changing the fourth digit to1 gives 8881, which is not divisible by7.

But according to the equations, it should be.

Wait, but perhaps N=8883 is invalid, but N=5624 is valid.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

Thus, Q=5, R=624, so Q + R=5 +624=629.

But wait, the problem says Q and R when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5624.

5624 ÷1000=5 quotient, remainder 624.

So, Q=5, R=624.

Thus, Q + R=5 +624=629.

But wait, I thought N=8883 was a higher number, but it failed some conditions.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in N=8883.

Wait, N=8883.

Changing first digit:1883 ÷7=269, yes.

Changing second digit:8183 ÷7=1169, yes.

Changing third digit:8813 ÷7=1258.714..., no.

Wait, according to Equation (3):6A +2B + D≡4 mod7.

With A=8, B=8, D=3:6*8 +2*8 +3=48 +16 +3=67≡4 mod7.

So, AB1D=8813 should be divisible by7.

But 8813 ÷7=1258.714..., which is not.

So, contradiction.

Thus, N=8883 is invalid.

Thus, N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, but is there a higher N than 5624?

Wait, let me try N=6946.

But as above, it's invalid.

Wait, N=7561: invalid.

Wait, N=8163: invalid.

Wait, N=8120: invalid.

Wait, N=6946: invalid.

Wait, N=5624 is the maximum.

Thus, the answer is Q + R=5 +624=629.

But I have to confirm if N=5624 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, let me check another way.

Wait, let me find all four-digit numbers N=abcd such that changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

So, N=abcd.

Changing a to1:1bcd must be divisible by7.

Changing b to1:a1cd must be divisible by7.

Changing c to1:ab1d must be divisible by7.

Changing d to1:abc1 must be divisible by7.

So, four conditions.

So, for N=5624:

1bcd=624. 624 ÷7=89.142..., which is not divisible.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, no, 1bcd=1624. 1624 ÷7=232, which is divisible.

Similarly, a1cd=5124 ÷7=732, divisible.

ab1d=5614 ÷7=802, divisible.

abc1=5621 ÷7=803, divisible.

So, all four conditions satisfied.

But what about N=6946.

Changing a to1:1 9 4 6=1946 ÷7=278, yes.

Changing b to1:6 1 4 6=6146 ÷7=878, yes.

Changing c to1:6 9 1 6=6916 ÷7=988, yes.

Changing d to1:6 9 4 1=6941 ÷7=991.571..., no.

Thus, invalid.

So, N=6946 is invalid.

Thus, N=5624 is the maximum.

Therefore, the answer is Q + R=5 +624=629.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{629}
</think>

To find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to satisfy four conditions:

1. Changing the first digit to 1: \( 1BCD \) must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the second digit to 1: \( A1CD \) must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the third digit to 1: \( AB1D \) must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the fourth digit to 1: \( ABC1 \) must be divisible by 7.

We denote \( N \) as \( 1000A + 100B + 10C + D \). Converting these conditions into modular arithmetic, we get the following equations:

1. \( 6 + 2B + 3C + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6A + 2 + 3C + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6A + 2B + 3 + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6A + 2B + 3C + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

After solving these equations step by step, we find that the highest number \( N \) that satisfies all conditions is 5624. 

When \( N = 5624 \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 624. Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{629}
\]
