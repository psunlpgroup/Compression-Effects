Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Sarah could have gone to the market based on the information provided.

First, let's list out all the sightings:

1. **James** saw Sarah near the Eiffel Tower from 6am to 10am.
2. **Betty** saw Sarah buying cookies at a bakery from 10am to 12pm.
3. **William** saw Sarah walking in the garden from 12pm to 1pm.
4. **John** saw Sarah working at the office from 1pm to 2pm.
5. **Steven** saw Sarah driving to the water park from 6pm to 7pm.

Now, the market was closed after 7pm. So, Sarah couldn't have gone to the market after 7pm.

Let's analyze the timeline:

- From 6am to 10am: James saw Sarah near the Eiffel Tower. This means Sarah was likely in Paris during this time.
- From 10am to 12pm: Betty saw Sarah buying cookies at a bakery. This suggests Sarah was in the area near the bakery during this time.
- From 12pm to 1pm: William saw Sarah walking in the garden. So, Sarah was in the garden during this hour.
- From 1pm to 2pm: John saw Sarah working at the office. This indicates Sarah was at work during this time.
- From 6pm to 7pm: Steven saw Sarah driving to the water park. So, Sarah was driving to the water park during this time.

Now, the market was closed after 7pm, so Sarah couldn't have gone to the market after 7pm. However, we need to check if there's any time before 7pm when she could have gone to the market.

Looking at the sightings, the last one is at 7pm. So, the latest Sarah was seen is at 7pm.

Therefore, the only possible time Sarah could have gone to the market is **before 6pm**, but we need to check if there's any gap in the sightings where she wasn't observed.

From the timeline:

- 6am to 10am: Sarah was near the Eiffel Tower.
- 10am to 12pm: Buying cookies.
- 12pm to 1pm: Walking in the garden.
- 1pm to 2pm: Working at the office.
- 6pm to 7pm: Driving to the water park.

There doesn't seem to be a gap where Sarah wasn't observed. However, the market was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone after that. But the latest she was seen is at 7pm, driving to the water park.

Therefore, the only possible time she could have gone to the market is **before 6pm**, but we need to see if there's a specific window when she wasn't observed.

Wait, actually, from 2pm to 6pm, there's no sightings of Sarah. So, she could have gone to the market during that time.

So, the possible time is from 2pm to 6pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 6pm to 7pm  
(B) 1pm to 2pm  
(C) 10am to 12pm  
(D) 2pm to 6pm

The correct answer is **(D) 2pm to 6pm**.

The correct answer is (D) 2pm to 6pm.
