Alright, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion that FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the premise states that a Japanese game company created the game The Legend of Zelda. So, we know that at least one game on the Top 10 list was made by a Japanese company. Next, it says that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies. Wait, does that mean every single game on that list is Japanese-made, or that they are all made by companies from Japan? I think it's the latter, meaning each game on the list is produced by a Japanese company. So, the Top 10 list consists entirely of Japanese games.

Then, the premise mentions that if a game sells more than one million copies, it will be included in the Top 10 list. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies, so it's on that list. From the first point, we know that The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese company, and since it's on the Top 10 list, all other games there must also be Japanese-made.

Now, the conclusion is about FIFA 22. I know FIFA is a popular video game series, and FIFA 22 was released in 2022. I'm not sure who made it. I think EA Sports makes the FIFA games, but EA is an American company. So, if FIFA 22 is made by EA, then the conclusion would be false because EA is not a Japanese company.

But wait, the premise says all Top 10 games are made by Japanese companies. So, if FIFA 22 is on that list, it must be made by a Japanese company. However, I don't think FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list. Let me check my knowledge. The Top 10 list is likely based on sales or popularity. I believe FIFA 22 did sell well, but I'm not sure if it's in the top 10. If it's not on the list, then the premise doesn't apply to it, making the conclusion uncertain.

Alternatively, if FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list, then by the premise, it must be made by a Japanese company. But I don't recall FIFA being made by a Japanese company. Typically, EA Sports, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts, an American company, develops FIFA. So, that would mean the conclusion is false.

Wait, but the premise says all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies. So, if FIFA 22 is on that list, then it must be made by a Japanese company, but I think it's not. Therefore, the premise might not be entirely accurate, or the conclusion could be false.

But perhaps the premise is a hypothetical scenario, not actual facts. So, based on the premise, we have to assume that all Top 10 games are Japanese-made. Therefore, if FIFA 22 is on that list, the conclusion would be true. But if it's not on the list, the conclusion is uncertain because we don't know if it's made by a Japanese company.

Wait, but the premise also says that The Legend of Zelda is on the list and made by a Japanese company. So, the premise is setting up that the Top 10 list only includes Japanese games. Therefore, any game on that list, including FIFA 22 if it's there, is made by a Japanese company. But I don't think FIFA 22 is on that list. So, the conclusion would be uncertain because we don't know if FIFA 22 is on the list or not.

Alternatively, if the premise is that the Top 10 list consists only of Japanese games, and FIFA 22 is on that list, then the conclusion would be true. But since I don't know if FIFA 22 is on the list, the conclusion is uncertain.

Wait, but the premise doesn't specify whether FIFA 22 is on the list or not. It only tells us that The Legend of Zelda is on the list and made by a Japanese company. So, without knowing if FIFA 22 is on the list, we can't conclude whether it's made by a Japanese company or not. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.

Alternatively, if the premise is that the Top 10 list consists of all Japanese games, and FIFA 22 is one of them, then the conclusion would be true. But since we don't know if FIFA 22 is on the list, the conclusion is uncertain.

I think the key here is that the premise only tells us about The Legend of Zelda being on the list and made by a Japanese company, and that all games on the list are made by Japanese companies. It doesn't provide information about other games on the list, like FIFA 22. Therefore, we can't definitively say whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company or not because we don't know if it's on the list or not.

So, based on the given premise, the conclusion is uncertain because we don't have information about whether FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list, which would determine if it's made by a Japanese company.

The conclusion that FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company is **uncertain**. The premise only confirms that The Legend of Zelda, a game on the Top 10 list, is made by a Japanese company and that all games on the list are Japanese-made. However, there is no information provided about whether FIFA 22 is included in this list. Without knowing if FIFA 22 is on the list, we cannot determine if it is made by a Japanese company. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.
