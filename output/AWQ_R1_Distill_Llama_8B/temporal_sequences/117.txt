Alright, let's try to figure out when Steven could have gone to the gas station. 

First, I'll list out all the times when Steven was seen by others and where he was:

- **7am to 10am**: Steven was stretching at a yoga studio.
- **1pm to 2pm**: Steven was reading at the library.
- **2pm to 3pm**: Steven was working at the office.
- **3pm to 7pm**: Steven was watching a movie at the theater.
- **7pm to 10pm**: Steven was waiting at the train station.

Now, the gas station was closed after 10pm. So, Steven couldn't have gone to the gas station after 10pm.

Let's see during which time Steven wasn't seen by anyone and could have possibly gone to the gas station.

- From **7am to 10am**, Steven was at the yoga studio. So, he couldn't have gone to the gas station then.
- From **1pm to 2pm**, he was at the library. So, no gas station visit.
- From **2pm to 3pm**, he was at the office. No gas station visit.
- From **3pm to 7pm**, he was at the theater. No gas station visit.
- From **7pm to 10pm**, he was at the train station. So, no gas station visit.

Wait, it looks like Steven was seen the whole time from 7am to 10pm. There's no time left for him to go to the gas station because the gas station was closed after 10pm. So, actually, Steven couldn't have gone to the gas station at all.

But that doesn't match any of the options given. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Oh, maybe the time he was at the yoga studio is from 7am to 10am. If the gas station was open during that time, but he was at the yoga studio instead. So, he didn't go to the gas station then.

From 1pm to 2pm, he was at the library. 2pm to 3pm, office. 3pm to 7pm, theater. 7pm to 10pm, train station.

So, there's no window when he was free to go to the gas station before it closed at 10pm.

Therefore, the answer should be that he couldn't have gone to the gas station because he was occupied elsewhere the whole time.

But looking at the options, none say he couldn't have gone. So maybe I need to pick the time when he wasn't seen but could have gone.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see:

- 7am to 10am: yoga
- 10am to 1pm: ?
- 1pm to 2pm: library
- 2pm to 3pm: office
- 3pm to 7pm: theater
- 7pm to 10pm: train station

So, the only time he wasn't seen is between 10am to 1pm and possibly other times when he was at different places.

Wait, actually, the times given are specific when he was at different places. So, from 10am to 1pm, he was not at the yoga studio, library, office, or theater. So, maybe he went to the gas station during that time.

But the options are:

(A) 7am to 10am
(B) 7pm to 10pm
(C) 10am to 1pm
(D) 3pm to 7pm

So, the only possible time he wasn't seen is 10am to 1pm, which is option C.

Therefore, Steven could have gone to the gas station between 10am to 1pm.

But wait, let me double-check. The problem says the gas station was closed after 10pm, so he couldn't have gone after that. But he was seen at the train station from 7pm to 10pm, so he was there until 10pm when the gas station closed.

But he was at the train station from 7pm to 10pm, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station during that time because he was occupied.

So, the only time he wasn't seen is between 10am to 1pm, which is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

But let me make sure. If Steven was at the yoga studio from 7am to 10am, then he couldn't have gone to the gas station during that time. Then, from 10am to 1pm, he wasn't at any of the places mentioned, so he could have gone to the gas station.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the answer is C.
