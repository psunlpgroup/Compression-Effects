Alright, let's try to figure out when Ashley could have gone to the beach. So, Ashley woke up at 7am. That's our starting point.

First, Elizabeth saw Ashley stretching at a yoga studio from 7am to 8am. So, Ashley was at the yoga studio during that time.

Then, Samantha saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 11am. So, Ashley was at the deli during that window.

After that, Jennifer saw Ashley buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 5pm. So, Ashley was at the mall from 11am to 5pm.

Now, the beach was closed after 6pm. That means the beach was open up until 6pm, and after that, it was closed.

So, we need to find a time when Ashley wasn't doing any of those activities and when the beach was still open.

Let's look at Ashley's schedule:

- 7am to 8am: Yoga studio
- 8am to 11am: Deli
- 11am to 5pm: Mall

So, the only time when Ashley wasn't at the yoga studio, deli, or mall is between 5pm and 6pm, because the beach was closed after 6pm.

Wait, but the options don't have 5pm to 6pm as an option. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options:
(A) 8am to 11am
(B) 11am to 5pm
(C) 5pm to 6pm
(D) 7am to 8am

Oh, option (C) is 5pm to 6pm. So, that's the time when Ashley could have gone to the beach because that's the only window when she wasn't doing anything else and the beach was still open.

So, the answer should be (C).
</think>

The correct answer is (C) 5pm to 6pm.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Ashley was at the yoga studio from 7am to 8am.
2. She was buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 11am.
3. She was buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 5pm.
4. The beach was closed after 6pm.
5. The only available time for Ashley to go to the beach is between 5pm and 6pm.

Answer: (C)
