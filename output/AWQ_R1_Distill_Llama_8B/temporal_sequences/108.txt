Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the orchestra hall. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, William woke up at 5am. That's the earliest time we know. Then, Thomas saw William working out at the gym from 5am to 10am. So, William was at the gym from 5am to 10am. 

Next, Lisa saw William taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 12pm to 4pm. So, that's a few hours later. I should note that the time from 10am to 12pm isn't covered by anyone's sightings, so William could have been doing other things during that window.

Then, Mary saw William sitting on a rooftop from 4pm to 7pm. That means he was there during the late afternoon and early evening. 

The orchestra hall was closed after 7pm. So, William couldn't have gone there after 7pm because it was closed.

Now, let's piece this together. William was at the gym from 5am to 10am. Then, from 10am to 12pm, there's a gap where nobody saw him. It's possible he was doing something else, maybe taking a break or moving around. 

After that, Lisa saw him from 12pm to 4pm. Then, Mary saw him from 4pm to 7pm. 

So, William was occupied from 5am to 10am, then from 12pm to 4pm, and then from 4pm to 7pm. The time between 10am and 12pm, and from 7pm onwards, he wasn't seen by anyone. 

The orchestra hall was closed after 7pm, so William couldn't have gone there after that time. That means the latest he could have gone is before 7pm.

Looking at the options provided:

- **(A) 10am to 12pm**: This is a possible time because no one saw him during this period. He could have gone to the orchestra hall then.

- **(B) 4pm to 7pm**: Mary saw him during this time, so he was occupied sitting on a rooftop. He couldn't have gone to the orchestra hall then.

- **(C) 12pm to 4pm**: Lisa saw him during this time, so he was taking photos. He couldn't have gone to the orchestra hall then.

- **(D) 5am to 10am**: Thomas saw him at the gym during this time, so he was busy working out. He couldn't have gone to the orchestra hall then.

So, the only possible time when he wasn't seen by anyone is between 10am to 12pm. That's when he could have gone to the orchestra hall.

The correct answer is (A) 10am to 12pm.

**Answer: (A)**
