Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion "All squares are shapes." is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the premises are:
1. All squares are four-sided.
2. All four-sided things are shapes.

I need to see if these premises logically lead to the conclusion. 

Starting with the first premise: All squares have four sides. That makes sense because a square is a quadrilateral with equal sides and angles. So, if something is a square, it must have four sides.

The second premise says that all four-sided things are shapes. A shape is a two-dimensional figure, like a polygon or a circle. So, if something is four-sided, it falls under the category of shapes.

Now, connecting these two premises. If all squares are four-sided, and all four-sided things are shapes, then by substitution, all squares must be shapes. That seems straightforward.

I don't see any contradictions here. Squares are indeed four-sided, and four-sided things are shapes. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.

I don't think there's any uncertainty here because the premises are clear and directly related. There's no hidden information or exceptions mentioned, so the conclusion should be true.

The conclusion "All squares are shapes." is **true** based on the premises.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 1:** All squares are four-sided. This defines squares as quadrilaterals with four sides.
   
2. **Premise 2:** All four-sided things are shapes. This includes all four-sided figures under the category of shapes.

3. **Logical Connection:** Since all squares are four-sided (from Premise 1) and all four-sided things are shapes (from Premise 2), substituting the first into the second logically leads to the conclusion that all squares are shapes.

4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, All squares are shapes.

**Answer:** True
