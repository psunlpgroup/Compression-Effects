Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the museum based on the information provided. 

First, let's list out all the events and the times when they happened:

1. **David woke up at 6am.**
2. **Thomas saw David on the rooftop from 6am to 7am.**
3. **Sarah saw David taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 8am.**
4. **Sean saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8am to 10am.**
5. **Samantha saw David driving to the water park from 12pm to 1pm.**
6. **Andrew saw David stretching at a yoga studio from 1pm to 8pm.**
7. **The museum was closed after 8pm.**

Okay, so the museum was closed after 8pm, which means David couldn't have gone there after 8pm. Let's see when David was available.

From the timeline:

- **6am to 7am:** David was on the rooftop.
- **7am to 8am:** David was taking photos.
- **8am to 10am:** David was fixing the computer.
- **12pm to 1pm:** David was driving to the water park.
- **1pm to 8pm:** David was stretching at the yoga studio.

So, during these times, David was either busy or occupied elsewhere. The only times when David wasn't doing these activities are:

- Before 6am: Not mentioned, but David was just waking up.
- Between 10am and 12pm: No activities mentioned.
- After 8pm: Museum was closed.

But wait, after 8pm, the museum was closed, so David couldn't have gone then. Let's look again.

From 10am to 12pm: No one saw David during this time. So, maybe he went to the museum during this window.

Also, after 8pm, he was at the yoga studio until 8pm, so he couldn't have gone to the museum after that.

So, the possible time he could have gone is between 10am to 12pm or between 12pm to 1pm. But wait, from 12pm to 1pm, he was driving to the water park.

So, the only time left is between 10am to 12pm.

Therefore, the answer should be (C) 10am to 12pm.

But wait, let me double-check.

From 8am to 10am: He was fixing the computer.

From 10am to 12pm: No one saw him, so he could have gone to the museum during this time.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is (C).

The correct answer is (C) 10am to 12pm.

Answer: (C)
