Alright, let's try to figure out when Leslie could have gone to the movies based on the timeline provided.

First, let's list out the information we have:

- Leslie woke up at 6am.
- Susan saw Leslie sitting on a rooftop from 6am to 7am.
- Mary saw Leslie working at the office from 12pm to 2pm.
- Steven saw Leslie getting a coffee at the cafe from 2pm to 7pm.
- The movies was closed after 7pm.

So, we need to find a time window where Leslie wasn't doing any of these other activities.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **From 6am to 7am:**
   - Susan saw Leslie on the rooftop during this time. So, Leslie was not at the movies.

2. **From 7am to 12pm:**
   - There's no information about what Leslie was doing during this period. Susan's sighting ends at 7am, and Mary's sighting starts at 12pm. So, this is a possible time when Leslie could have gone to the movies.

3. **From 12pm to 2pm:**
   - Mary saw Leslie working at the office during this time. So, Leslie was occupied at work and couldn't have gone to the movies.

4. **From 2pm to 7pm:**
   - Steven saw Leslie getting coffee at the cafe during this period. So, Leslie was not at the movies.

5. **After 7pm:**
   - The movies were closed after 7pm. So, Leslie couldn't have gone to the movies after this time.

Putting this all together, the only time when Leslie wasn't seen doing anything else is between **7am to 12pm**. During this window, there's no information about Leslie's activities, which means she could have gone to the movies.

So, the correct answer should be the time between 7am to 12pm, which is option (A).

The correct answer is:

(A) 7am to 12pm

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Leslie's activities from the timeline:**
   - **6am to 7am:** Susan saw Leslie on the rooftop.
   - **12pm to 2pm:** Mary saw Leslie working at the office.
   - **2pm to 7pm:** Steven saw Leslie at the cafe.

2. **Determine the time Leslie wasn't observed:**
   - Between **7am to 12pm**, there's no information about Leslie's activities, making this the only available time for her to visit the movies.

**Answer:** (A) 7am to 12pm
