Okay, let's try to figure out when Nancy could have gone to the physics classroom. I'll go through the information step by step.

1. **Nancy's Wake-up Time:** She wakes up at 5am. So, she starts her day at 5am.

2. **James's Observation:** James saw Nancy sitting on a rooftop from 5am to 6am. That means Nancy was on the rooftop during that time.

3. **Jennifer's Observation:** Jennifer saw Nancy walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6am to 8am. So, after 6am, Nancy was walking.

4. **Elizabeth's Observation:** Elizabeth saw Nancy buying a bike at the bike shop from 8am to 10am. So, from 8am onwards, she was buying a bike.

5. **Michael's Observation:** Michael saw Nancy attending class at the school from 12pm to 5pm. So, in the afternoon, she was in class.

6. **Closure of the Physics Classroom:** It was closed after 5pm. So, any time after 5pm, the classroom was closed.

Now, we need to find the time when Nancy could have gone to the physics classroom. Let's see her schedule:

- 5am to 6am: On the rooftop.
- 6am to 8am: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty.
- 8am to 10am: Buying a bike.
- 12pm to 5pm: Attending class.

Looking at her schedule, there's a gap between 10am and 12pm when she isn't accounted for. That's the time when she might have gone to the physics classroom.

Also, Michael saw her in class from 12pm to 5pm, which is after the classroom was open. The classroom was closed after 5pm, so she must have gone to the physics classroom before 5pm.

So, the possible time she could have gone is between 10am to 12pm, which is option (A).

But wait, let me double-check. The options are:

(A) 10am to 12pm

(B) 5am to 6am

(C) 8am to 10am

(D) 12pm to 5pm

Yes, 10am to 12pm fits the gap in her schedule when she wasn't doing anything specific according to the observations. So, that's when she could have gone to the physics classroom.

The correct answer is (A) 10am to 12pm.

**Answer: (A)**
