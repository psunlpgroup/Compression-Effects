Let's analyze the timeline step by step:

1. **William wakes up at 6am.**
   
2. **Anthony saw William getting a coffee at the cafe from 6am to 7am.**
   
   - During this time, William is at the cafe.

3. **John saw William watching a movie at the theater from 8am to 10am.**
   
   - William is at the theater during this period.

4. **Hannah saw William waiting at the train station from 10am to 12pm.**
   
   - William is at the train station during this time.

5. **Mark saw William walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 12pm to 1pm.**
   
   - William is walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this period.

6. **William saw William working out at the gym from 1pm to 6pm.**
   
   - William is at the gym from 1pm to 6pm.

7. **The art studio was closed after 6pm.**
   
   - Therefore, William could not have gone to the art studio after 6pm.

Based on the timeline, the only time William is not accounted for is between **7am to 8am**.

During this time, William is not seen at any of the mentioned locations. Since the art studio was closed after 6pm, William likely used this unaccounted time to visit the art studio.
