Alright, let's try to figure out when Tiffany could have gone to the market. I'll start by listing out the information given and then see how it all fits together.

First, Tiffany woke up at 5am. That means her day started at 5am.

Next, Jason saw Tiffany driving to the water park from 5am to 6am. So, right after waking up, she was heading to the water park.

Then, Steven saw Tiffany getting a coffee at the cafe from 6am to 12pm. So, after the water park visit, she went to get coffee, and this took her from 6am to 12pm. That's a few hours, so she must have spent some time there.

After that, Jessica saw Tiffany buying lunch at the deli from 12pm to 4pm. So, right after getting coffee, she went to buy lunch, and this took her from 12pm to 4pm. That's another couple of hours.

Then, Thomas saw Tiffany working at the office from 5pm to 7pm. So, after buying lunch, she went to work, and this lasted until 7pm.

Now, the market was closed after 7pm, which means she couldn't have gone to the market after 7pm.

Let me summarize the timeline:

- 5am: Woke up.
- 5am-6am: Driving to water park.
- 6am-12pm: Getting coffee.
- 12pm-4pm: Buying lunch.
- 4pm-5pm: ?
- 5pm-7pm: Working at office.
- After 7pm: Market closed.

So, the question is, between what times could Tiffany have gone to the market? The options are:

(A) 6am to 12pm
(B) 4pm to 5pm
(C) 5am to 6am
(D) 5pm to 7pm

Looking at the timeline, after buying lunch at 4pm, she started working at the office at 5pm. So, she was busy from 4pm to 5pm, but that's when she started working. Before that, from 12pm to 4pm, she was buying lunch. So, there's a gap between 4pm and 5pm when she wasn't working yet. That's when she could have gone to the market.

But wait, the market was closed after 7pm. So, she could have gone anytime before 7pm. However, she started working at 5pm and worked until 7pm. So, she was occupied during that time.

Wait, let me double-check. If she started working at 5pm, that means she was at work from 5pm to 7pm. So, she couldn't have gone to the market during that time because she was working.

Before that, she was buying lunch from 12pm to 4pm. So, the earliest she could have gone to the market is after 4pm but before 5pm. That's the window when she wasn't doing anything else.

So, the possible time is between 4pm to 5pm, which is option (B).

But wait, the market was closed after 7pm, but she could have gone earlier. However, the latest she could have gone is before 5pm because she started working then.

Yes, so the answer should be (B) 4pm to 5pm.

The correct answer is (B) 4pm to 5pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Tiffany's Schedule:**
   - Wakes up at 5am.
   - Visits the water park from 5am to 6am.
   - Gets coffee from 6am to 12pm.
   - Buys lunch from 12pm to 4pm.
   - Works at the office from 5pm to 7pm.

2. **Determine Available Time for Market Visit:**
   - After buying lunch at 4pm, the next activity is working at 5pm.
   - Therefore, the only free time before work is between 4pm and 5pm.

3. **Consider Market Hours:**
   - The market closes after 7pm, so she can go anytime before 7pm.
   - However, she starts working at 5pm, so she must have gone to the market before 5pm.

**Answer:** (B) 4pm to 5pm
