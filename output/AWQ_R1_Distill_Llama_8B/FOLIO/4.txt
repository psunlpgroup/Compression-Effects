Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion that James does not have lunch in the company is true or false based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down each premise and see how they connect.

First, the premise says that all employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. So, if someone schedules a meeting, they're definitely at the office. That seems straightforward.

Next, it mentions that everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. So, if someone is having lunch at the office, they must have scheduled a meeting. That implies a cause-effect relationship: lunching at the office leads to scheduling a meeting.

Then, it states that employees have lunch either in the company building or at home. So, each employee's lunch location is one of these two options. That means some have lunch at work, others at home.

If an employee has lunch at home, they're working remotely from home. So, lunching at home is a sign they're working remotely. That makes sense because if you're at home, you can't be at the office.

All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. So, if you're in another country, you must be working from home. That's a specific case, but it's relevant because it tells us about the location of employees.

No managers work remotely from home. So, managers don't have lunch at home; they must have lunch at the company building. That's an important point because it ties into the next premise.

James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager. So, James being in the company today is only possible if he's a manager. If he's not a manager, he won't be there. This is a bi-conditional, meaning both directions: if James is a manager, he's in the company today, and if he's in the company today, he's a manager.

Now, let's try to connect these. From the fourth premise, since no managers work remotely, if James is a manager, he must be having lunch in the company building. Because if he were a manager, he wouldn't be working from home, so he must be at the office for lunch.

Wait, but the second premise says that everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules a meeting. So, if James is a manager, he's having lunch at the office, which means he scheduled a meeting. But does that mean he's necessarily at the office today?

Yes, because if he's a manager, he must be in the company today (from the fifth premise). So, he's having lunch at the company, which means he scheduled a meeting, which aligns with the first premise.

But the conclusion is that James does not have lunch in the company. That seems contradictory. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, no, the conclusion is that James does not have lunch in the company. But according to the premises, if James is a manager, he must be having lunch at the company. So, that would mean the conclusion is false.

But let me double-check. If James is a manager, he can't work remotely, so he must be at the company building today. Therefore, he must have lunch there, which means he scheduled a meeting. So, the conclusion that James does not have lunch at the company is false.

I think that's the logical deduction. So, the conclusion is false because James, being a manager, must be having lunch at the company building today.

The conclusion that James does not have lunch in the company is **false**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Manager's Lunch Location**: No managers work remotely (Premise 4). Therefore, if James is a manager, he must have lunch at the company building (since he can't be at home).

2. **James's Presence**: James will be at the company today only if he is a manager (Premise 5). Since he is a manager, he must be there.

3. **Lunch and Meetings**: Those who have lunch at the company schedule meetings (Premise 2). As James is a manager, he must have scheduled a meeting, hence he is at the company for lunch.

4. **Conclusion**: The statement claims James does not have lunch at the company, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
