Alright, let's try to figure out when Emily could have gone to the orchestra hall. So, the timeline given is:

- **Emily wakes up at 5am.**
- **Linda saw Emily waiting at the airport from 5am to 6am.**
- **David saw Emily buying cookies at a bakery from 2pm to 7pm.**
- **Michael saw Emily buying clothes at the mall from 7pm to 8pm.**
- **Thomas saw Emily working out at the gym from 8pm to 10pm.**
- **The orchestra hall was closed after 10pm.**

First, let's list out all the time frames when Emily was spotted:

1. **5am to 6am** (Linda at the airport)
2. **2pm to 7pm** (David at the bakery)
3. **7pm to 8pm** (Michael at the mall)
4. **8pm to 10pm** (Thomas at the gym)

Now, we need to find the time when Emily was NOT spotted, because the orchestra hall was closed after 10pm. So, Emily must have gone to the orchestra hall during a time when she wasn't seen by anyone else.

Let's analyze the gaps between these observed times:

- Between **6am to 2pm**: There's no information about where Emily was. This is a potential window she could have gone to the orchestra hall.
- Between **7pm to 8pm**: Michael saw her at the mall, so she was buying clothes then.
- Between **8pm to 10pm**: Thomas saw her at the gym.

So, the only time she wasn't seen by anyone is between **6am to 2pm**. That's a significant block of time where she wasn't observed doing anything specific.

Let's double-check:

- **5am to 6am**: At the airport with Linda.
- **6am to 2pm**: No one saw her. This is the possible time she went to the orchestra hall.
- **2pm to 7pm**: At the bakery with David.
- **7pm to 8pm**: At the mall with Michael.
- **8pm to 10pm**: At the gym with Thomas.

Since the orchestra hall was closed after 10pm, and Thomas saw her at the gym until 10pm, she couldn't have gone to the orchestra hall after that.

Therefore, the only feasible time when she could have gone to the orchestra hall is **6am to 2pm**.

Emily could have gone to the orchestra hall between **6am to 2pm**.

**Answer: (D) 6am to 2pm**
