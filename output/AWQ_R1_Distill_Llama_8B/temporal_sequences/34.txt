Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the gas station. So, David wakes up at 5am. Then, Jennifer saw him taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 9am. Kimberly saw him buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 3pm. Linda saw him walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 9pm. The gas station was closed after 9pm.

First, let's list out the times when David was seen by Jennifer, Kimberly, and Linda:

- **Jennifer:** 7am to 9am
- **Kimberly:** 9am to 3pm
- **Linda:** 3pm to 9pm

Now, we need to find the times when David was not seen by anyone, because during those times, he might have gone to the gas station. Since the gas station was closed after 9pm, we don't need to consider times after that.

Let's start from the earliest time David was seen, which is 7am by Jennifer. Before that, from 5am to 7am, David was likely at home or elsewhere, as there's no mention of him being seen during that time.

So, one possible time for David to go to the gas station is between **5am to 7am**.

Next, after Jennifer saw him at 9am, Kimberly saw him buying a bike from 9am to 3pm. So, during this period, David was likely busy buying the bike. Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the gas station during this time.

Then, after Linda saw him at 3pm, he started walking towards the Statue of Liberty until 9pm. Since the gas station was closed after 9pm, and Linda saw him until 9pm, there's no time left for him to go to the gas station during this period.

So, the only time when David wasn't seen by anyone and could have gone to the gas station is between **5am to 7am**.

Wait, but let's double-check. From 5am to 7am, David was not seen by anyone. He could have gone to the gas station during that time.

Is there any other time? After 7am, he was seen by Jennifer until 9am, then Kimberly from 9am to 3pm, and Linda from 3pm to 9pm. So, no other windows are left.

Therefore, the only possible time is **5am to 7am**.

But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe he went to the gas station during one of the times when he was seen by someone else? No, because during those times, he was either taking photos or buying a bike or walking, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station.

So, yes, the only time is **5am to 7am**.

Wait, but the options given are:

(A) 5am to 7am

(B) 7am to 9am

(C) 3pm to 9pm

(D) 9am to 3pm

So, option A is 5am to 7am, which is the only time he wasn't seen by anyone, and thus, he could have gone to the gas station.

But let me think again. Is there a possibility that he went to the gas station during 7am to 9am when Jennifer saw him? But if he was taking photos, he probably didn't go to the gas station during that time.

Similarly, during 9am to 3pm, he was buying a bike, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station then.

From 3pm to 9pm, he was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so again, he couldn't have gone to the gas station.

So, yes, the only time is 5am to 7am.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A)** 5am to 7am.

The correct answer is (A) 5am to 7am.

**Answer: (A)**
