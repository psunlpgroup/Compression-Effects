To determine the possible times Michael could have gone to the clothing store, let's analyze the information provided.

First, Michael wakes up at 5am. The clothing store is closed after 10pm. Therefore, Michael's visit must have occurred between 5am and 10pm.

Next, let's look at the timeline of Michael's activities:

- **5am:** Wakes up.
- **6am to 1pm:** Andrew saw Michael at the train station.
- **1pm to 3pm:** Sarah saw Michael walking towards the Statue of Liberty.
- **3pm to 6pm:** Mary saw Michael walking in the garden.
- **6pm to 9pm:** Lisa saw Michael taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
- **9pm to 10pm:** Elizabeth saw Michael fixing their computer at the electronic store.

From the timeline, Michael was continuously observed from 6am until 10pm, without any gaps in his activities. Since the clothing store was closed after 10pm, Michael would have needed to visit before 10pm.

Therefore, the latest Michael could have gone to the clothing store is by 10pm, but based on the observations, the last activity before 10pm was from 9pm to 10pm, which involved fixing the computer at the electronic store.

Since the clothing store was closed after 10pm, Michael would not have been able to visit it after 10pm. Therefore, the latest possible time he could have gone to the clothing store is before 10pm.

Looking at the options provided:

- **(A) 1pm to 3pm:** This is a possible time as Michael was observed walking towards the Statue of Liberty during this period.
- **(B) 9pm to 10pm:** This is not possible because Michael was fixing the computer during this time, and the clothing store was closed after 10pm.
- **(C) 6am to 1pm:** This is possible as Andrew saw Michael at the train station during this time.
- **(D) 5am to 6am:** This is not possible because Michael was awake at 5am but there is no mention of him being at the clothing store during this time.

Thus, the possible times are **1pm to 3pm** and **6am to 1pm**.

However, based on the observations, Michael was continuously occupied from 6am to 10pm, so the specific time he went to the clothing store would have been during his free moments within this period.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) 1pm to 3pm**.

The correct answer is (A).
