Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion that Harry is smarter than before is true or not based on the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the premise says that books contain tons of knowledge. That makes sense because books are a primary source of information and learning. So, the first premise is pretty straightforward.

Next, it states that when a person reads a book, they gain knowledge. This seems logical. Reading expands one's understanding and awareness, so that's a valid connection.

Then, the third part says if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. Hmm, this is where it gets a bit tricky. I know that gaining knowledge typically does lead to an increase in intelligence or smartness, but it's not a direct cause-and-effect for everyone. Some people might read a book but not necessarily retain or apply the knowledge in a way that significantly changes their overall intelligence.

Now, the conclusion is Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau. So, applying the premises, if Harry read the book, he gained knowledge, and thus he should be smarter than before.

Wait, but is this always the case? Maybe Harry didn't understand the book, or maybe he didn't apply the knowledge. Or perhaps the book didn't contain new information for him. Also, intelligence can be influenced by many factors beyond just knowledge gain, like emotional state, opportunities for application, etc.

So, logically, the premises support that Harry might be smarter, but it's not a certainty. It's possible, but there's no guarantee. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain based on the given information.

The conclusion that Harry is smarter than before is **uncertain** based on the given premises. While reading a book typically leads to knowledge gain, which can contribute to increased intelligence, there are no guarantees that this will always result in a significant improvement in smartness for any individual. Therefore, the conclusion does not definitively follow from the premises.
