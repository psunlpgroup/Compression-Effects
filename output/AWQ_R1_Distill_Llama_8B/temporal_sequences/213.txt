Alright, so let's try to figure out when Elizabeth could have gone to the art studio. I need to look at all the information given and piece it together step by step.

First, Elizabeth woke up at 6am. So her day starts at 6am.

Next, Sean saw Elizabeth buying lunch at the deli from 6am to 8am. That means Elizabeth was at the deli during that time.

Then, Lisa saw Elizabeth working at the office from 8am to 9am. So after the deli, Elizabeth went to work at the office.

David saw Elizabeth stretching at a yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm. So somewhere between her office work and the Statue of Liberty, she stopped at the yoga studio.

Samantha saw Elizabeth walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 1pm to 5pm. So after the yoga studio, she was heading to the Statue of Liberty.

It's also mentioned that the art studio was closed after 5pm. So the art studio must have been open before 5pm.

Now, I need to find the time window when Elizabeth could have gone to the art studio. She was at the deli from 6am to 8am, then at the office from 8am to 9am, at the yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm, and then walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 1pm to 5pm.

So, the gaps in her schedule are:

- Between 9am to 12pm: She was at the office until 9am and then possibly at the yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm. Wait, but David saw her at the yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm. So she must have gone from the office to the yoga studio.

But wait, the office was from 8am to 9am. So after that, she went to the yoga studio at 12pm, meaning there's a gap between 9am to 12pm when she wasn't at the office or the yoga studio.

Similarly, after the yoga studio at 1pm, she started walking towards the Statue of Liberty until 5pm.

So, the possible times when she could have gone to the art studio are during the gaps in her schedule.

From the timeline:

- 6am to 8am: At the deli
- 8am to 9am: At the office
- 9am to 12pm: Gap (not at the office or yoga studio)
- 12pm to 1pm: At the yoga studio
- 1pm to 5pm: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty

So, the only gap where she wasn't doing those activities is between 9am to 12pm.

Therefore, Elizabeth could have gone to the art studio between 9am to 12pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 9am to 12pm

(B) 8am to 9am

(C) 6am to 8am

(D) 12pm to 1pm

So, the correct answer is (A) 9am to 12pm.

The correct answer is (A) 9am to 12pm.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Elizabeth's schedule:
   - 6am to 8am: Buying lunch at the deli.
   - 8am to 9am: Working at the office.
   - 12pm to 1pm: Stretching at the yoga studio.
   - 1pm to 5pm: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

2. The gaps in her schedule are:
   - 9am to 12pm: Not working at the office or at the yoga studio.

3. Therefore, the only possible time she could have gone to the art studio is during this gap.

Answer: (A) 9am to 12pm
