Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Andrew's Wake-up Time**: Andrew wakes up at 6am.

2. **Jessica's Observation**: Jessica saw Andrew stretching at a yoga studio from 6am to 11am.

3. **Elizabeth's Observation**: Elizabeth saw Andrew walking in the garden from 11am to 6pm.

4. **Emily's Observation**: Emily saw Andrew watching a movie at the theater from 8pm to 9pm.

5. **Basketball Court Closure**: The basketball court was closed after 9pm.

Now, let's determine the possible time Andrew could have gone to the basketball court.

- **From 6am to 11am**: Andrew was at the yoga studio according to Jessica.
  
- **From 11am to 6pm**: Andrew was walking in the garden according to Elizabeth.
  
- **From 8pm to 9pm**: Andrew was at the theater according to Emily.
  
- **After 9pm**: The basketball court was closed, so it's not possible for Andrew to have gone there after 9pm.

Therefore, there is no time between 6am and 6pm when Andrew could have gone to the basketball court without overlapping with his activities observed by Jessica and Elizabeth.

However, the options provided include (D) 6pm to 8pm, which is a possible window if Andrew finished his activities earlier.

Given the information, the most plausible time Andrew could have gone to the basketball court is between **6pm to 8pm**.

**Answer:** (D)
