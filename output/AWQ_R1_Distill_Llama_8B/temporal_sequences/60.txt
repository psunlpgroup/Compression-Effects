Alright, let's try to figure out when Thomas could have gone to the gas station based on the information provided.

First, let's list out all the sightings of Thomas throughout the day:

1. **Samantha saw Thomas stretching at a yoga studio from 9am to 12pm.**
2. **Thomas saw himself buying cookies at a bakery from 12pm to 1pm.**
3. **Kimberly saw Thomas working at the office from 1pm to 4pm.**
4. **Andrew saw Thomas waiting at the train station from 4pm to 5pm.**
5. **Ashley saw Thomas buying clothes at the mall from 5pm to 8pm.**

We also know that **Thomas woke up at 8am** and the gas station was closed after 8pm.

So, let's analyze the timeline step by step.

- **From 8am to 9am:** Thomas was asleep because he just woke up at 8am. So, he couldn't have gone to the gas station during this time.
  
- **From 9am to 12pm:** Samantha saw Thomas stretching at the yoga studio. During this time, Thomas was at the yoga studio, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station.

- **From 12pm to 1pm:** Thomas saw himself buying cookies at the bakery. So, Thomas was at the bakery during this hour. He couldn't have gone to the gas station.

- **From 1pm to 4pm:** Kimberly saw Thomas working at the office. Thomas was busy working, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station during this time.

- **From 4pm to 5pm:** Andrew saw Thomas waiting at the train station. Thomas was waiting there, so he couldn't have gone to the gas station.

- **From 5pm to 8pm:** Ashley saw Thomas buying clothes at the mall. So, Thomas was at the mall during this time. He couldn't have gone to the gas station.

Finally, the gas station was closed after 8pm, so Thomas couldn't have gone to the gas station after 8pm.

Putting it all together, it seems that there's no time when Thomas was free to go to the gas station. However, based on the options provided, the closest time when Thomas wasn't spotted by anyone is between **8am to 9am**. Even though Thomas was asleep at that time, technically, he wasn't doing anything else, so he could have potentially gone to the gas station.

Therefore, the best answer is **(A) 8am to 9am**.

The correct answer is (A) 8am to 9am.

**Answer: (A)**
