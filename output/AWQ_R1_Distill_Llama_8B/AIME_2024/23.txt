Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list. The list has some specific properties: the sum of the items is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page. The **mode** of a list is the number that appears most frequently. Since it's specified as the **unique** mode, that means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. The **median** is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one; if it's even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, which is a bit confusing because the median is a value that could be an average of two numbers, but it's described as a positive integer not in the list. So that tells me that the median isn't a number in the list, but it is an integer. Hmm, so maybe the list has an odd number of elements, making the median a single number, which isn't present in the list.

Let me jot down what I know:

1. Sum of the list: 30.
2. Unique mode is 9.
3. Median is a positive integer not in the list.

So, I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies these conditions, and then find the sum of the squares of its items.

Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. So, the number of times 9 appears is greater than the number of times any other number appears. That gives me a starting point.

Next, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which isn't in the list. If it's even, the median is the average of two middle numbers, which is an integer, but it's not present in the list either. So, in both cases, the median is an integer, but not part of the list.

Let me consider the number of elements in the list. Let's denote the number of elements as \( n \). If \( n \) is odd, the median is the \( \frac{n+1}{2} \)-th term. If \( n \) is even, the median is the average of the \( \frac{n}{2} \)-th and \( \frac{n}{2}+1 \)-th terms, which is an integer. But in either case, this median value isn't in the list.

Wait, so if the median is not in the list, that means for odd \( n \), the middle term isn't 9 because 9 is the mode. Hmm, unless the middle term is something else. So, the median is a different number, but it's an integer.

I think it's better to try to figure out the possible lengths of the list.

Let me assume the list has an odd number of elements first, say \( n = 2k + 1 \). Then the median is the \( (k+1) \)-th term. If the median is not in the list, then that term is different from all the elements. Similarly, for even \( n = 2k \), the median is the average of the \( k \)-th and \( (k+1) \)-th terms, which is an integer, but it's not present in the list.

So, in both cases, the median is not one of the list's elements.

Let me try to figure out the possible number of elements. Maybe starting with smaller lists.

Wait, but the sum is 30, so the list can't be too small or too big. Let me see.

Let me also consider the mode. The mode is 9, so 9 appears more than any other number. So, at least two 9s, but probably more.

Let me also think about the median. If the median is not in the list, it's an integer, but it's not part of the list. So, for example, if the median is 5, and 5 is not in the list, that's okay.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer not in the list, so it's an integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. So, for instance, if the median is 5, then 5 is not in the list, but the average of two numbers is 5, or it's the middle number if the list is odd.

So, the median is an integer, but not in the list.

So, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the possible lengths of the list.

Let me think about the number of elements. If the list is too short, the median would be too low or something. Let me try to figure out a possible number of elements.

Let me denote the number of elements as \( n \).

Case 1: \( n \) is odd, say \( n = 2k + 1 \).

Case 2: \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2k \).

I need to figure out which case applies.

Let me think about the median.

Suppose \( n \) is odd: median is the \( (k+1) \)-th term.

Suppose \( n \) is even: median is average of \( k \)-th and \( (k+1) \)-th terms, which is an integer.

But in either case, the median is not in the list.

So, if the median is an integer not in the list, that could be helpful.

Let me also think about the mode. Since 9 is the mode, the number of 9s is higher than any other number. So, if I have multiple 9s, I need to make sure that no other number appears as many times.

So, for example, if I have two 9s, then other numbers can have at most one occurrence. If I have three 9s, other numbers can have at most two, etc.

So, first, let me try to figure out the minimal number of 9s. Since it's the unique mode, it must appear at least twice.

But if other numbers can't appear as many times as 9.

So, suppose 9 appears three times. Then other numbers can appear at most two times.

Alternatively, if 9 appears two times, then other numbers can appear at most once.

But to have the median not in the list, maybe we need some spread in the numbers.

Let me try to structure the list.

First, I have to include multiple 9s.

Let me assume that the list has 9 appearing three times.

So, 9, 9, 9.

Then, the rest of the numbers have to be such that their sum is 30 - 3*9 = 30 - 27 = 3.

So, the remaining numbers sum to 3.

But since 9 is the mode, other numbers can't appear more than two times.

But wait, if 9 appears three times, then other numbers can appear at most two times.

But the remaining sum is 3, so we can have numbers like 1, 2, or 3.

But let me see.

Wait, if I have three 9s, that's 27. Then, the remaining sum is 3, so we can have numbers like 1, 1, 1, but since 1 can only appear twice (as other numbers can't exceed two times), then:

Wait, if 9 appears three times, then any other number can appear at most two times.

So, 3 can be broken down into numbers where each number appears at most two times.

So, 3 can be 1, 1, 1: but that would be three 1s, which is more than two. So, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, 3 can be 1, 1, 1, but that's three 1s again.

Wait, but 3 can also be 1, 2: that's two numbers, each appearing once.

But in that case, the list would have 3 nines, 1, 2, and that's it.

So, the list is [9, 9, 9, 1, 2]. Let me check the sum: 9+9+9+1+2 = 30.

Good. Now, let's check the mode: 9 appears three times, 1 and 2 appear once. So, 9 is the unique mode. Good.

Now, what is the median of this list? Let's arrange the list in order: 1, 2, 9, 9, 9. So, the median is the middle term, which is the third term: 9. But 9 is in the list. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, this doesn't satisfy the condition.

So, that's a problem.

Hmm, so maybe having three 9s is not the way to go because the median becomes 9, which is in the list.

So, perhaps I need to have fewer 9s, but enough to make it the unique mode.

Wait, so if I have two 9s, then other numbers can only appear once.

So, let me try that.

So, two 9s: sum is 18. Remaining sum is 12.

So, the remaining numbers have to sum to 12, with each number appearing at most once.

So, we can have numbers like 1, 2, 3, 6, but each only once.

So, for example, the list could be [9, 9, 1, 2, 3, 6]. Let's check the sum: 9+9+1+2+3+6=30. Good.

Now, check the mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, 9 is the unique mode.

Now, the median: since there are six numbers, the median is the average of the third and fourth terms.

So, ordered list: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 9. The third and fourth terms are 3 and 6. The average is (3+6)/2=4.5. But the problem states the median is a positive integer not in the list. 4.5 is not an integer, so that doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, okay. So, maybe I need an odd number of elements so that the median is a single number.

Let me try with five elements.

Wait, if n=5, then the median is the third term.

So, let's try that.

Again, starting with two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12.

But with five elements, I have to have two 9s, and the other three numbers summing to 12.

But each of those three numbers can appear at most once since 9 is the unique mode.

So, the remaining three numbers can be 1, 2, 9, but wait, 9 is already the mode. If I have another 9, then 9 would appear three times, which would still be the mode, but let me see.

Wait, no, the remaining numbers should not include 9 because otherwise, 9 would appear three times, which is okay, but then the mode is still 9, but it's unique.

But let me see.

Wait, if I have two 9s and then three numbers: 3, 4, 5, but that sums to 12. So, the list would be [9,9,3,4,5]. Let's check the sum: 9+9+3+4+5=30. Good.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode is 9. Good.

Median: the third term is 3, which is in the list. But the problem states the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if I have two 9s and three numbers that don't include 3, 4, 5 but maybe 1, 2, 9? Wait, but 9 is already in the list.

Wait, if I have two 9s and three numbers: 1, 2, 9, that would make four 9s, but then 9 would be the mode with four times, which is okay, but the list would be [9,9,9,9,1,2], but wait, that's six elements.

Wait, no, if n=5, two 9s and three other numbers: 1, 2, 9 is not possible because that would make four 9s, but we can only have three numbers besides the two 9s.

Wait, maybe 1, 2, 9 is three numbers, but that would require 1, 2, and 9, but 9 is already in the two 9s.

Wait, perhaps 1, 2, and 3? Then, the list is [9,9,1,2,3]. The sum is 9+9+1+2+3=24. That's not 30.

Wait, so perhaps 1, 2, 8? Let me check: 9+9+1+2+8=29, still not 30.

Wait, maybe 1, 2, 9: but that would give 9+9+1+2+9=30, but that's four 9s, which is okay, but then the list is [9,9,9,9,1,2], which is six elements, but we were considering n=5.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe n=7? Let me try n=7.

So, with two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12, spread over five numbers, each at most once.

So, numbers could be 1,2,3,6, but that's four numbers, sum is 12.

Wait, 1+2+3+6=12, but that's four numbers, so with two 9s, that's six numbers, but I need seven. So, one more number.

Wait, but we can't have another number because the remaining sum is 12, but adding another number would require another positive integer, which would make the sum exceed 12.

Wait, maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 2: but that would have two 2s, which would make 2 appear twice, same as 9. So, 9 is no longer unique mode.

Hmm, tricky.

Wait, perhaps n=5, two 9s, and three other numbers. So, two 9s, and three numbers that sum to 12, each appearing once.

So, 1, 2, 9: but 9 is already in the list.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3: sum is 6, which is too low.

Wait, 1, 2, 9: but 9 is already there.

Wait, 1, 2, 10: 10 is allowed, but 10 is a positive integer.

But 1+2+10=13, which is more than 12.

Hmm, so that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe 1, 3, 8: sum is 12.

So, the list is [9,9,1,3,8]. Sum: 9+9+1+3+8=30. Mode: 9 appears twice, others once, so unique mode is 9.

Median: since n=5, the third term is 3, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that's not okay.

Alternatively, maybe n=7? Let's try that.

Wait, two 9s, sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over five numbers, each at most once.

Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2: but that's two 2s, which would make 2 appear twice, same as 9, so mode isn't unique.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 6: sum is 12, but that's four numbers, so with two 9s, that's six numbers. I need seven.

Wait, so maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 2: but again, duplicates.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2: same problem.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible to have n=5 or n=7 with two 9s. Maybe I need more 9s.

Wait, let's try three 9s. So, sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over n-3 numbers.

So, for n=5: three 9s, and two numbers summing to 3.

But those two numbers can be 1 and 2, each appearing once.

So, the list is [9,9,9,1,2]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears three times, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: n=5, third term is 9, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, so three 9s give a median that's in the list.

What if I have four 9s? So, four 9s: sum is 36, which is more than 30. So, that's not possible.

Wait, four 9s would be 4*9=36, which is over 30, so that's too much.

So, maybe three 9s is too many because the median becomes 9, which is in the list.

Wait, but the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list, so in this case, the median is 9, which is in the list, which is not allowed.

So, perhaps I need to have more 9s so that the median shifts.

Wait, but that might not be possible because with more 9s, the median would still be 9.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose the list has an even number of elements, say n=6.

So, the median is the average of the third and fourth terms.

So, let's try to create a list where the average of the third and fourth terms is an integer not in the list.

Also, the mode is 9, appearing more times than any other number.

So, for n=6, let me see.

First, let's have three 9s: sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over three numbers.

So, the remaining three numbers must sum to 3, each appearing at most two times.

But since 9 is the mode, others can appear at most two times.

So, 3 can be broken down as 1, 1, 1, but that's three 1s, which is more than two.

Alternatively, 3 can be 1, 2, but that's two numbers, each once.

So, the list would be [9,9,9,1,2, something]. Wait, but the sum is 9+9+9+1+2=30, but we have five elements, so the sixth element would have to be 0, which is not a positive integer. So, that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe n=6 with two 9s.

So, two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over four numbers.

Each of these four numbers can appear at most once because 9 is the unique mode.

So, 12 can be split into 1, 2, 3, 6: all positive integers, each appearing once.

So, the list is [9,9,1,2,3,6]. Sum is 9+9+1+2+3+6=30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: average of third and fourth terms: 2 and 3. So, median is 2.5, which is not an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that's not okay.

Alternatively, if I have two 9s, and four numbers that sum to 12, each appearing once.

Wait, if I have two 9s, and four numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6. That gives the median as 2.5, which is not an integer. So, that's not good.

Alternatively, if I have two 9s, and four numbers: 1, 1, 3, 7. But then 1 appears twice, same as 9, so 9 is no longer the unique mode.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe n=6 is not possible.

Wait, perhaps n=8.

Wait, let's try n=8.

So, with two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over six numbers.

Each of these six numbers can appear at most once because 9 is the unique mode.

So, 12 can be split into 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, but that's two 2s, which would make 2 appear twice, same as 9.

So, not allowed.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 6: four numbers, each once.

But that would only cover 12 with four numbers, but we need six numbers.

So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe n=8 with three 9s.

So, three 9s: sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over five numbers.

Each of these five numbers can appear at most once because 9 is the unique mode.

So, 3 can be split into 1, 2, but that's two numbers, so we have three 9s, 1, 2, and then we need five numbers, so we need three more numbers, but 1+2+ something would exceed 3.

Wait, 1, 2, and then 0, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe 1, 1, 1, but that's three 1s, which would make 1 appear three times, same as 9, so mode is not unique.

Hmm, tricky.

Wait, maybe n=4.

Two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over two numbers.

But then, two numbers can be 6 and 6, but that would make 6 appear twice, same as 9, so mode is not unique.

Alternatively, 12 can be split into 1 and 11, each appearing once.

So, the list is [9,9,1,11]. Sum is 30. Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: average of second and third terms: (9+1)/2=5, which is an integer, and 5 is not in the list. Perfect!

Okay, so this works.

So, the list is [1,9,9,11]. Wait, ordered list: [1,9,9,11]. So, the median is the average of the second and third terms: (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, hold on. If n=4, the median is the average of the second and third terms. So, in the list [1,9,9,11], the second and third terms are both 9. So, the median is 9, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that's not acceptable.

Wait, so maybe n=4 is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to try n=6 again.

Wait, if n=6, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Wait, the median is the average of the third and fourth terms.

So, if the average is an integer, that means the third and fourth terms are both odd or both even.

So, for their average to be integer, the third and fourth terms must be both odd or both even.

So, if I can create a list where the third and fourth terms are both 5, for example, then the median would be 5, which is not in the list.

Wait, but 5 is not in the list. So, let me try.

So, let's have two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over four numbers.

Let me try to arrange the list such that the third and fourth terms are both 5.

So, list would be something like [a, b, 5, 5, c, d], where a, b, c, d are positive integers.

But the sum of the list is 30.

So, sum = 9+9+5+5 + a + b + c + d = 30.

So, 9+9+5+5=28, so a + b + c + d=2.

But a, b, c, d are positive integers, so the minimum each can be is 1.

So, 1+1+1+1=4, which is more than 2. So, that's not possible.

So, that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the third and fourth terms are 4 and 6, so the average is 5, which is not in the list.

Wait, let's try that.

So, list is [a, b, 4, 6, c, d]. So, sum is 9+9+4+6 + a + b + c + d=30.

So, 9+9+4+6=28, so a + b + c + d=2.

Again, same problem: a, b, c, d must be at least 1 each, so sum is at least 4, which is more than 2. Not possible.

Hmm, maybe the median is 4, which is not in the list.

Wait, let me think of a list where the median is 4.

So, for n=6, the median is (third + fourth)/2=4.

So, third and fourth terms must be 4 and 4, or 3 and 5, or 2 and 6, etc.

If they are both 4, then the list is [a, b,4,4,c,d]. Sum is 9+9+4+4 + a + b + c + d=30.

So, 9+9+4+4=26, so a + b + c + d=4.

So, a, b, c, d are positive integers, each at least 1.

So, 1+1+1+1=4, which is exactly the remaining sum.

So, the list is [1,1,4,4,1,1], but wait, that's four 1s and two 4s.

But then, the mode is 1, which is not 9. So, that's a problem because the unique mode is supposed to be 9.

So, in this case, 1 appears four times, 4 appears twice, so 1 is the mode, not 9. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, if the third and fourth terms are 3 and 5, then the median is 4, which is not in the list.

So, list is [a, b,3,5,c,d]. Sum is 9+9+3+5 + a + b + c + d=30.

So, 9+9+3+5=26, so a + b + c + d=4.

Again, same problem: a, b, c, d must be at least 1 each, so 1+1+1+1=4.

So, the list is [1,1,3,5,1,1], which again gives mode as 1, not 9.

Alternatively, maybe have two 1s, one 2, one 1, but that would make mode as 1 again.

So, seems like it's impossible to have the median as 4 without making 1 the mode.

Hmm, so maybe n=6 is not possible.

Wait, maybe n=8.

Let me try n=8.

So, two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over six numbers.

Each of these six numbers can appear at most once because 9 is the unique mode.

So, 12 can be split into 1, 2, 3, 6: four numbers, each once.

But we need six numbers, so we need two more numbers, but they have to be at least 1 each, which would make the sum exceed 12.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2: but that's two 2s, making 2 appear twice, same as 9.

So, mode is not unique.

Alternatively, maybe 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3: but that's two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, which would make 1, 2, 3 each appear twice, same as 9. So, mode is not unique.

Hmm, tricky.

Wait, maybe n=5.

Wait, n=5: let's try three 9s.

Sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over two numbers.

So, 3 can be split into 1 and 2.

So, list is [9,9,9,1,2]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears three times, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: the third term is 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe n=7.

Three 9s: sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over four numbers.

Each of these four numbers can appear at most once.

So, 3 can be split into 1, 2, but that's two numbers, so we need four numbers.

So, 1, 1, 1, 0: but 0 is not allowed.

Alternatively, 1, 1, 2, -1: not allowed.

Hmm, can't do that.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, and something: but 1+2+3=6, which is more than 3.

So, no good.

Wait, maybe n=7 is not possible.

Wait, maybe n=4.

Two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over two numbers.

So, 12 can be split into 6 and 6, but then 6 appears twice, same as 9, so mode is not unique.

Alternatively, 12 can be split into 1 and 11: each once.

So, list is [9,9,1,11]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: average of second and third terms: (9 + 1)/2=5, which is an integer not in the list. Perfect!

Wait, okay, so this works.

So, the list is [1,9,9,11]. Wait, no, ordered list: [1,9,9,11]. So, the median is the average of the second and third terms: (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not good.

Wait, but if the list is [1,9,11,9], when sorted it's [1,9,9,11], so the median is 9, which is in the list.

Hmm, that's not acceptable.

Wait, maybe I need to have the median as a different number.

Wait, but in n=4, the median is the average of the second and third terms.

So, if I can make the second and third terms such that their average is an integer not in the list.

So, for example, if the second term is 5 and the third term is 7, then the median is 6, which is not in the list.

So, let me try that.

So, list is [something,5,7,something]. So, 5 and 7 are the second and third terms.

So, let's have two 9s, so two 9s, and two numbers: 5 and 7.

So, the list would be [9,9,5,7]. Sum is 9+9+5+7=30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, 5 and 7 once. So, unique mode is 9.

Median: average of second and third terms: (9 + 5)/2=7, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, that's a problem.

Alternatively, if the second term is 4 and the third term is 8, then the median is 6, which is not in the list.

So, let me try that.

So, list is [something,4,8,something]. Let's have two 9s, so two 9s, and two numbers: 4 and 8.

So, the list is [9,9,4,8]. Sum is 9+9+4+8=30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: average of second and third terms: (9 + 4)/2=6.5, which is not an integer. So, that's not acceptable.

Hmm, so that's not good.

Alternatively, if the second term is 3 and the third term is 7, then the median is 5, which is not in the list.

So, let's try that.

List is [something,3,7,something]. Two 9s, so two 9s, and two numbers: 3 and 7.

So, list is [9,9,3,7]. Sum is 9+9+3+7=28. Not 30.

We need an extra 2. So, maybe [9,9,3,7,1,1]. But that's six elements, with two 1s, which would make 1 appear twice, same as 9. So, mode is not unique.

Alternatively, [9,9,3,7,2]. That's five elements, sum is 9+9+3+7+2=30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: the third term is 3, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Hmm, not good.

Wait, maybe I need to have the median as a number not in the list, so maybe the second and third terms average to something not in the list.

Wait, maybe I can have the second term as 2 and the third term as 8, so the average is 5, which is not in the list.

So, list is [something,2,8,something]. Two 9s, so two 9s, and two numbers: 2 and 8.

So, list is [9,9,2,8]. Sum is 9+9+2+8=28. Need 2 more, so maybe add a 2: [9,9,2,8,2]. But that's five elements, with two 2s, same as 9s.

So, mode is not unique.

Alternatively, [9,9,2,8,1,1]. Sum is 9+9+2+8+1+1=30. Mode: 9 appears twice, 1 and 2 once, 8 once. So, unique mode is 9.

Median: average of third and fourth terms: (2 + 8)/2=5, which is not in the list. Perfect!

So, the list is [1,1,2,8,9,9]. When ordered: [1,1,2,8,9,9]. The median is (2 + 8)/2=5, which is not in the list.

So, that works!

So, the list is [1,1,2,8,9,9]. Let me verify all conditions:

1. Sum: 1+1+2+8+9+9=30. Good.

2. Unique mode: 9 appears twice, others once or twice. Wait, 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice, 2 and 8 once. So, both 1 and 9 appear twice. So, the mode is both 1 and 9. But the problem says the unique mode is 9. So, that's a problem.

Ah, okay, so that's an issue.

So, in this case, 1 appears twice, same as 9, so the mode is not unique.

So, that's not acceptable.

Hmm, so I need to ensure that 9 is the only number that appears more than once.

So, perhaps I need to have only 9 appear twice, and all others once.

So, let me try again.

So, for n=6, two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over four numbers, each appearing once.

So, 12 can be split into 1, 2, 3, 6.

So, the list is [9,9,1,2,3,6]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode is 9.

Median: average of third and fourth terms: (1 + 2)/2=1.5, not an integer. So, not good.

Alternatively, if the remaining four numbers are 1, 1, 3, 7: but that's two 1s, making 1 appear twice, same as 9.

So, mode is not unique.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 6: each once. So, the list is [9,9,1,2,3,6]. As before.

But median is 1.5, not integer.

Alternatively, maybe have three 9s: sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over three numbers.

So, numbers could be 1, 1, 1: but that's three 1s, same as 9.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 0: but 0 is not allowed.

Alternatively, 1, 1, 1: same problem.

So, n=6 is tricky.

Wait, maybe n=7.

Three 9s: sum is 27, remaining sum is 3 over four numbers.

Each of these four numbers can appear at most once.

So, 3 can be split into 1, 2, but that's two numbers, so we need four numbers.

So, 1, 1, 1, 0: not allowed.

Alternatively, 1, 1, 2, -1: nope.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe n=4 is possible.

Two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over two numbers.

So, numbers can be 6 and 6: but that's two 6s, same as 9s, so mode is not unique.

Alternatively, 12 can be split into 11 and 1: each once.

So, list is [9,9,11,1]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: average of second and third terms: (9 + 11)/2=10, which is not in the list. Perfect!

So, the list is [1,9,9,11]. Wait, ordered list: [1,9,9,11]. So, the median is (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, so that doesn't work.

Wait, but if I have two 9s and two numbers: 6 and 6, that would make two 6s, same as 9s, so mode is not unique.

Alternatively, two 9s and two numbers: 10 and 2. So, list is [9,9,10,2]. Sum is 30.

Ordered: [2,9,9,10]. Median is (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, same issue.

Alternatively, two 9s and two numbers: 4 and 8. So, list is [9,9,4,8]. Sum is 30.

Ordered: [4,9,9,8]. Wait, that's not correct, it should be [4,8,9,9]. Wait, no, 4,8,9,9.

Wait, no, 4,8,9,9 is incorrect because 8 is greater than 4 but less than 9.

Wait, ordered list is [4,8,9,9]. So, the median is (8 + 9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. So, that's not acceptable.

Wait, but if the two numbers are 5 and 7, then list is [9,9,5,7]. Sum is 30.

Ordered: [5,7,9,9]. Median is (7 + 9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Perfect!

So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Let me check:

1. Sum: 5+7+9+9=30. Good.

2. Unique mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode is 9.

3. Median: (7 + 9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Perfect!

So, this works.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Wait, but in reality, the list should have four elements. So, the elements are 5,7,9,9. So, when ordered: 5,7,9,9. Median is 8, which is not in the list. Perfect.

So, that's a valid list.

So, now, the problem asks for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

So, the items are 5,7,9,9.

Compute the squares: 5²=25, 7²=49, 9²=81, 9²=81.

Sum:25 + 49 + 81 +81=25+49=74; 74+81=155; 155+81=236.

So, the sum of the squares is 236.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible lists.

Wait, is there another list with different numbers that satisfies the conditions?

For example, could the list be [3,3,9,9,9,9], but that's six elements.

Wait, sum is 3+3+9+9+9+9=42, which is over 30.

Alternatively, maybe [2,2,9,9,9,9], sum is 2+2+9+9+9+9=30.

Wait, so 2+2+9+9+9+9=30.

Mode: 9 appears four times, 2 appears twice. So, unique mode is 9.

Median: average of third and fourth terms: (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, [2,2,3,3,9,9,9,9], but that's eight elements.

Sum:2+2+3+3+9+9+9+9=36, which is over 30.

Alternatively, [1,1,2,2,3,3,9,9,9,9], but that's ten elements, sum would be 1+1+2+2+3+3+9+9+9+9=35, still over 30.

Wait, maybe too many 9s.

Wait, perhaps n=4 is the only possible.

Wait, n=4, two 9s, and two numbers: 5 and 7.

Which gives us [5,7,9,9], as above.

Alternatively, could the two numbers be 4 and 8: [4,8,9,9], sum is 30, but the median is 8.5, not integer.

Alternatively, 3 and 9: but 9 is already in the list.

Wait, 3 and 9: so list is [3,9,9,9], sum is 30, but mode is 9, appears three times.

Median: third term is 9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, 2 and 10: list is [2,10,9,9], sum is 30.

Median: (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, 1 and 11: list is [1,11,9,9], sum is 30.

Median is 9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, 6 and 6: list is [6,6,9,9], sum is 30.

Mode: 6 and 9 both appear twice, so mode is not unique.

So, that's not good.

Alternatively, 4 and 7: list is [4,7,9,9], sum is 30.

Median is (7 + 9)/2=8, which is not in the list. So, that works.

So, [4,7,9,9]. So, same as before.

Wait, so same as the previous list.

So, seems like n=4 is the only possible case.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9] or [4,7,9,9], both give sum of squares 236.

Wait, hold on, let me compute the squares again.

First list: [5,7,9,9].

Squares:25,49,81,81.

Sum:25+49=74; 74+81=155; 155+81=236.

Second list: [4,7,9,9].

Squares:16,49,81,81.

Sum:16+49=65; 65+81=146; 146+81=227.

Wait, so that's different.

Wait, so depending on the list, the sum of squares can be different.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, both lists satisfy the conditions:

1. Sum is 30.

2. Unique mode is 9.

3. Median is a positive integer not in the list.

So, both are valid.

But the problem says "the list", implying a unique answer.

So, perhaps I need to find all possible lists and compute the sum of squares for each, then see if they all give the same result.

Wait, in the first case, [5,7,9,9], sum of squares is 236.

In the second case, [4,7,9,9], sum of squares is 227.

So, different results.

Wait, so the problem might have multiple solutions, but in the problem statement, it's not specified whether the list is unique or not.

Wait, let me check the problem again.

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

• The sum of the items in the list is 30.

• The unique mode of the list is 9.

• The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

So, it's possible that there are multiple such lists, but the sum of squares is the same for all of them, or perhaps the problem expects the minimal or maximal sum.

Wait, but in our two cases, the sums are different.

Wait, so perhaps I need to find all possible lists and see if the sum is same.

Wait, let me think.

In the first case, [5,7,9,9], sum of squares is 236.

In the second case, [4,7,9,9], sum is 227.

Wait, so depending on the numbers, the sum of squares can vary.

So, perhaps the answer is not unique, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's said that the unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more times than any other number.

So, in the list [4,7,9,9], 9 appears twice, and 4 and 7 once each.

So, that's okay.

In the list [5,7,9,9], same thing: 9 appears twice, others once.

But in the list [3,3,9,9,9,9], 9 appears four times, 3 appears twice: so, mode is 9, unique.

But the median is 9, which is in the list, so that doesn't satisfy.

Wait, but is there another list where the median is not in the list?

Wait, n=4 seems to be the only case where the median is an integer not in the list.

Wait, n=5: let's see.

If n=5, and the unique mode is 9, which appears twice.

Wait, two 9s: sum is 18, remaining sum is 12 over three numbers.

Each of these three numbers can appear at most once.

So, 12 can be split into 1, 2, 9: but 9 is already in the list.

Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 6: but that's four numbers.

Wait, no, n=5, two 9s, and three numbers.

So, 12 can be 1, 2, 9: but 9 is already there.

Alternatively, 1, 3, 8: sum is 12.

So, the list is [9,9,1,3,8]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: third term is 3, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, if the three numbers are 2, 3, 7: sum is 12.

So, list is [9,9,2,3,7]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: third term is 2, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Alternatively, three numbers: 4, 4, 4: but that would make 4 appear three times, same as 9.

So, mode is not unique.

Alternatively, 1,1,10: but 1 appears twice, same as 9.

So, mode is not unique.

So, seems like n=5 is not possible.

Wait, so n=4 is the only case where the median is a positive integer not in the list.

So, in that case, the list is either [5,7,9,9] or [4,7,9,9], both have sum of squares 236 and 227, respectively.

Wait, but why is that?

Wait, in [5,7,9,9], 5 and 7 are the two numbers, but in [4,7,9,9], 4 and 7 are the two numbers.

So, depending on the numbers, the sum of squares can differ.

But in the problem statement, it doesn't specify any other conditions, so both lists are valid.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects the sum of squares to be 236, because in that list, the numbers are higher, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I missed another possible list.

Wait, let me think: are there other possible lists with n=4?

So, two 9s, and two numbers: a and b.

Sum:9+9+a+b=30, so a+b=12.

Also, the median is (9 + a)/2 if a <=9, or (9 + b)/2 if b <=9.

Wait, but the median is an integer not in the list.

So, (9 + a)/2 or (9 + b)/2 must be an integer not in the list.

So, for example, if a=5 and b=7, then the median is (9 + 5)/2=7, which is in the list. So, that's not good.

Wait, but if a=4 and b=8, then the median is (9 +4)/2=6.5, which is not an integer.

Wait, but that's not acceptable.

Wait, if a=3 and b=9, then the median is (9 +3)/2=6, which is not in the list.

But wait, the list would be [3,9,9,9], but that's four elements: 3,9,9,9.

Wait, no, n=4, two 9s and two numbers: 3 and 9. So, list is [3,9,9,9], but that's four elements, with three 9s, so mode is 9.

But the median is (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list.

So, that's not good.

Alternatively, a=6 and b=6: list is [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 6 and 9 both appear twice, so mode is not unique.

So, that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, a=2 and b=10: list is [2,10,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Median: (9 + 9)/2=9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, a=1 and b=11: list is [1,11,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Median: (9 +9)/2=9, in the list.

Alternatively, a=7 and b=5: same as before, median is 7, in the list.

Wait, so the only way to have the median as an integer not in the list is to have a and b such that (9 + a)/2 and (9 + b)/2 are integers not in the list.

Wait, so for (9 + a)/2 to be integer, 9 + a must be even, so a must be odd.

Similarly for (9 + b)/2 to be integer, b must be odd.

So, both a and b must be odd numbers.

So, a and b are positive integers, odd, such that a + b=12.

Possible pairs:

1 and 11: both odd.

3 and 9: both odd.

5 and 7: both odd.

7 and 5: same as above.

9 and 3: same as above.

11 and 1: same as above.

So, the possible pairs for a and b are (1,11), (3,9), (5,7), (7,5), (9,3), (11,1).

So, let's check each case.

Case 1: a=1, b=11.

List: [1,11,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Case 2: a=3, b=9.

List: [3,9,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears three times, unique.

Median: (9 +9)/2=9, in the list. Not allowed.

Case 3: a=5, b=7.

List: [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. Unique mode.

Median: (9 +9)/2=9, in the list. Wait, but earlier, I thought the median was 7, but no.

Wait, when sorted, the list is [5,7,9,9]. So, the median is the average of the second and third terms: (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So, in this case, the median is 8, which is not in the list.

So, this works.

Case 4: a=7, b=5.

Same as above, same list.

Case 5: a=9, b=3.

Same as case 2.

Case 6: a=11, b=1.

Same as case 1.

So, only when a=5 and b=7, the median is 8, which is not in the list.

So, only one valid list: [5,7,9,9].

So, that's the unique list.

Therefore, the sum of the squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81=236.

Therefore, the answer is 236.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}
</think>

Given a list of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

First, we determine the number of elements in the list. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements to ensure the median is the average of two numbers, neither of which is in the list.

We consider the list with the unique mode 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number. We find that the list must have four elements to satisfy the median condition. 

After several trials and ensuring the list meets all conditions, we find the valid list is [5, 7, 9, 9]. 

The sum of the squares of the items in this list is calculated as follows:

\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is:

\[
\boxed{236}
\]
