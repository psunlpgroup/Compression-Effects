Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the construction site. So, David wakes up at 7am. Then there are several sightings of David by different people:

- Michael saw David at the library from 7am to 9am.
- William saw David at the airport from 6pm to 8pm.
- Lisa saw David at the train station from 8pm to 10pm.

The construction site was closed after 10pm. So, we need to find a time when David was at the construction site, considering all these sightings and the fact that the construction site closes after 10pm.

First, let's list out the times:

- **7am to 9am**: David was at the library according to Michael.
- **6pm to 8pm**: David was at the airport according to William.
- **8pm to 10pm**: David was at the train station according to Lisa.

The construction site is closed after 10pm, so David can't be there after 10pm.

Now, let's see when David wasn't seen by anyone:

- Between 9am and 6pm: David wasn't spotted by anyone. This could be a possible time to go to the construction site.

- Between 7am to 9am: David was at the library, so he couldn't have been at the construction site then.

- Between 6pm to 8pm: David was at the airport, so he wasn't at the construction site.

- Between 8pm to 10pm: David was at the train station, so he wasn't at the construction site.

So, the only time when David wasn't seen by anyone and when the construction site was still open is between **9am to 6pm**.

Therefore, the possible time David could have gone to the construction site is from 9am to 6pm.
</think>

**Solution:**

David could have gone to the construction site between **9am to 6pm**.

**Answer:** (B) 9am to 6pm
