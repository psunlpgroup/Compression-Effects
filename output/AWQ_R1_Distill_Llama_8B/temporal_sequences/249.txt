Alright, let's try to figure out when Kimberly could have gone to the swimming pool. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then analyze the timeline step by step.

First, Kimberly woke up at 8am. That's a good starting point.

Emily saw Kimberly working out at the gym from 8am to 12pm. So, during these hours, Kimberly was at the gym.

Then, Betty saw Kimberly walking in the garden from 12pm to 4pm. So, after her gym session, Kimberly was in the garden during this time.

James saw Kimberly buying lunch at the deli from 5pm to 8pm. That means after the garden, Kimberly went to the deli and stayed there until 8pm.

Samantha saw Kimberly walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8pm to 9pm. So, after buying lunch, she walked towards the Statue of Liberty.

The swimming pool was closed after 9pm. That's important because it tells us that the pool wasn't open after 9pm.

Now, let's piece this together:

- **8am to 12pm**: Gym
- **12pm to 4pm**: Garden
- **5pm to 8pm**: Deli
- **8pm to 9pm**: Statue of Liberty

Wait, there's a gap between 4pm and 5pm. During that time, none of the people mentioned saw Kimberly. So, she must have been at the swimming pool during this unaccounted-for time.

But hold on, the swimming pool was closed after 9pm. That means it was open before 9pm. So, the latest she could have gone is before 9pm.

So, the time between 4pm and 5pm is the only period when she wasn't seen by anyone else, which suggests she was at the pool.

However, let's double-check the options provided:

(A) 5pm to 8pm – That's when she was at the deli, so she couldn't have gone to the pool then.

(B) 8am to 12pm – She was at the gym, so no.

(C) 8pm to 9pm – She was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so no.

(D) 4pm to 5pm – That's the only time she wasn't seen by anyone, so she must have gone to the pool.

Yes, that makes sense. The swimming pool was closed after 9pm, so she must have gone during 4pm to 5pm.

The correct answer is (D) 4pm to 5pm.

Answer: (D)
