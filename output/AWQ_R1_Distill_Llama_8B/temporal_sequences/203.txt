Let's analyze the timeline step by step to determine during which time Leslie could have gone to the soccer field.

**1. Leslie's Wake-Up Time:**
- Leslie wakes up at **5am**.

**2. Sarah's Observation:**
- Sarah saw Leslie waiting at the **train station** from **5am to 12pm**.
- This means Leslie was at the train station during this period.

**3. Hannah's Observation:**
- Hannah saw Leslie **sitting on a rooftop** from **12pm to 2pm**.
- This implies Leslie was occupied on the rooftop during this time.

**4. Elizabeth's Observation:**
- Elizabeth saw Leslie **buying a bike at the bike shop** from **3pm to 4pm**.
- Therefore, Leslie was at the bike shop during this period.

**5. Emily's Observation:**
- Emily saw Leslie **working at the office** from **4pm to 10pm**.
- This means Leslie was occupied at the office during this time.

**6. Soccer Field Closure:**
- The soccer field was closed **after 10pm**.

**Analyzing Leslie's Possible Availability:**
- **From 5am to 12pm:** Leslie was at the train station (as observed by Sarah).
- **From 12pm to 2pm:** Leslie was on the rooftop (as observed by Hannah).
- **From 3pm to 4pm:** Leslie was buying a bike (as observed by Elizabeth).
- **From 4pm to 10pm:** Leslie was working at the office (as observed by Emily).

**Determining the Time Leslie Could Have Gone to the Soccer Field:**
- **Between 2pm and 3pm:** Leslie was not observed by anyone to be at the soccer field or elsewhere specified. This seems to be a possible window.
- **After 10pm:** The soccer field was closed, so Leslie couldn't have gone after this time.

**Checking the Options:**
- **(A) 12pm to 2pm:** Leslie was on the rooftop during this time.
- **(B) 2pm to 3pm:** This is a time when Leslie wasn't observed to be at the soccer field or elsewhere specified.
- **(C) 4pm to 10pm:** Leslie was working at the office during this time.
- **(D) 5am to 12pm:** Leslie was at the train station during this time.

**Conclusion:**
The only feasible time when Leslie could have gone to the soccer field without conflicting with her other activities is **2pm to 3pm**.

**Answer:** (B)
