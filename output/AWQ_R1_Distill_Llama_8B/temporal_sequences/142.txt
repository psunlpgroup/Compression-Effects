Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the clothing store. I'll start by looking at the timeline provided and see where the clothing store fits in.

First, David wakes up at 6am. That's the earliest time he's moving around.

Then, Sarah saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 9am. So, between 8 and 9, he was heading to the statue.

Leslie saw him watching a movie at the theater from 9am to 11am. So, from 9 to 11, he was at the theater.

Emily saw him buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm. So, he was at the mall during that time.

Hannah saw him walking in the garden from 1pm to 3pm. So, he was in the garden between 1 and 3.

Samantha saw him reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm. So, he was at the library during that time.

The clothing store was closed after 4pm. That means David couldn't have gone there after 4pm.

Now, let's see when David was at the mall. Emily saw him there from 11am to 1pm. The clothing store is presumably where he would be buying clothes, so he likely went there during that time. But wait, the store was closed after 4pm, so maybe he went earlier.

Looking at his schedule, from 8am to 9am, he was walking towards the statue. Then from 9am to 11am, he was at the theater. So, the next time he's at a place where he might buy clothes is from 11am to 1pm at the mall. That seems like a good window.

But let's double-check. Was there another time he could have gone? After 1pm, he was in the garden until 3pm. The clothing store was closed after 4pm, so if he went later, he couldn't have. The library visit is after that, from 3pm to 4pm.

So, the only time he was at a place where he might buy clothes is from 11am to 1pm. That seems to be the only possible time he could have gone to the clothing store.

Wait, but the options given include 11am to 1pm, which is option A. But I also see that the store was closed after 4pm, but he went to the mall at 11am to 1pm, so that's before 4pm. So, that should be fine.

But hold on, the clothing store was closed after 4pm, but it doesn't say it was closed before that. So, he could have gone anytime before 4pm. His time at the mall is from 11am to 1pm, which is within the store's operating hours.

Therefore, the correct time he could have gone is from 11am to 1pm.

But let me look at the options again:

(A) 11am to 1pm

(B) 8am to 9am

(C) 6am to 8am

(D) 1pm to 3pm

Yes, 11am to 1pm is option A. So, that's the answer.

The correct answer is (A) 11am to 1pm.

**Answer: (A)**
