Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down each part of the argument.

First, the premise says: "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV." So, there's at least one show that's on TV at 8 pm on Monday and gives out roses. That means it's a specific instance, not a general rule.

Then, the next part is a conditional statement: "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor." So, whenever a show gives out roses, it must be The Bachelor. That means only The Bachelor gives out roses on TV, according to this premise.

Now, the Bachelor is portrayed as showing the lives of real people. So, The Bachelor is a reality TV show because it's showing real people's lives.

Next, we know that Breaking Bad is a show. And also, Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. So, Breaking Bad is a different type of show, probably a drama or something else.

Now, the conclusion is: "Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm." So, is Breaking Bad the show that gives out roses on Monday at 8 pm?

Let me see. From the premises, only The Bachelor gives out roses on TV. Breaking Bad doesn't give out roses; in fact, it's not a reality TV show. So, Breaking Bad isn't the one giving out roses.

Wait, but the premise says "some show," so maybe there are multiple shows that give out roses, but the conclusion is specifically about Breaking Bad. Since Breaking Bad doesn't give out roses, the conclusion is false.

But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The premises don't mention Breaking Bad giving out roses, and they explicitly state that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, which is the only type that gives out roses according to the previous step.

So, putting it all together: The only show that gives out roses is The Bachelor, which is a reality TV show. Breaking Bad is a different show, not a reality TV show, and doesn't give out roses. Therefore, the conclusion that Breaking Bad is the show giving out roses on Monday at 8 pm is incorrect.
</think>

The conclusion is false because Breaking Bad does not give out roses on TV as per the premises. Only The Bachelor, a reality TV show, gives out roses. Breaking Bad is a non-reality TV show and does not fit the premise of giving out roses.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
