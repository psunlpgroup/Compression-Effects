Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the premise says that breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals. Artificial selection is a process where humans selectively breed animals to pass on specific traits. So, if someone is breeding back animals, they're doing artificial selection.

Next, it mentions that Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble aurochs. I know aurochs are an extinct species of large wild cattle. So, by breeding Heck cattle to resemble aurochs, they're trying to bring back the traits of that ancient species.

Now, the conclusion is that some Heck cattle are artificially selected. Let's see if this follows logically from the premises.

From the first premise, breeding back is artificial selection. The second premise gives an example where Heck cattle are indeed being bred back to look like aurochs. So, in this specific case, Heck cattle are being artificially selected. Therefore, the conclusion seems to be supported by the premises.

I don't see any information that would contradict this. The premises don't mention any other factors that might negate the conclusion, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the conclusion is true.

The conclusion is **True**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 1:** Breeding back is a form of artificial selection. This means humans are selectively breeding animals to pass on specific traits.

2. **Premise 2:** Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble aurochs. Aurochs are extinct large wild cattle, so this implies a breeding effort to replicate their traits.

3. **Conclusion:** Some Heck cattle are artificially selected. Since breeding back is artificial selection and Heck cattle were indeed bred back, the conclusion is valid.

**Answer:** True
