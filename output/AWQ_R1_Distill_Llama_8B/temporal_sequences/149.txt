Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the art show. So, here's what we know:

1. **David's schedule:**
   - He woke up at 5am.
   - Samantha saw him working at the office from 5am to 7am.
   - Mary saw him taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 7am to 1pm.
   - Leslie saw him driving to the water park from 3pm to 8pm.
   - The art show was closed after 8pm.

2. **Key points to consider:**
   - David was at home at 5am.
   - From 5am to 7am, he was at the office.
   - From 7am to 1pm, he was taking photos.
   - From 3pm to 8pm, he was driving to the water park.
   - The art show closes after 8pm.

3. **When could he have gone to the art show?**
   - He was at the office until 7am.
   - Then he was taking photos until 1pm.
   - So, between 7am and 1pm, he was occupied.
   - Next, from 3pm to 8pm, he was driving.
   - The art show was closed after 8pm, so he couldn't have gone after that.
   - The only free time before the art show is between 1pm and 3pm.
   - During that time, he wasn't doing anything mentioned.
   - So, the possible time he could have gone is between 1pm and 3pm.

**Answer:** (D) 1pm to 3pm
