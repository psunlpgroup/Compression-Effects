["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out when Jason could have gone to the movies. ["end-section"] 

["adding-knowledge"] So, Jason woke up at 10 am. Then, Linda saw him getting coffee from 10 am to 3 pm. That means between 10 am and 3 pm, Jason was at the cafe. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, if he went to the movies, it couldn't be during that time because he was already at the cafe. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, Jennifer saw Jason walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6 pm to 7 pm. So, he was heading that way during that time. Then, Sean saw him buying a phone at the electronics store from 7 pm to 10 pm. That means from 7 pm to 10 pm, he was at the store. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The movies was closed after 10 pm, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so he couldn't have gone to the movies after 10 pm. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Looking at the options: - (A) 3 pm to 6 pm: He was at the cafe until 3 pm and then moving towards the Statue of Liberty. So, he wasn't free to go to the movies during this time. - (B) 10 am to 3 pm: He was getting coffee, so no. - (C) 7 pm to 10 pm: He was buying a phone, so no. - (D) 6 pm to 7 pm: He was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so no. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, none of these times seem possible because he was occupied elsewhere. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Maybe I missed something. Let me check again. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] He was at the cafe from 10 am to 3 pm, then moving towards the statue from 6 to 7 pm, and then buying a phone from 7 pm to 10 pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the only free time he had was between 3 pm to 6 pm, right? ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But wait, Linda saw him at the cafe until 3 pm, and then Jennifer saw him at 6 pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the time between 3 pm to 6 pm, he could have gone to the movies. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] So, the correct answer should be (A) 3 pm to 6 pm. ["end-section"]
