Alright, so I need to figure out during what time Jennifer could have gone to the amusement park. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, Jennifer wakes up at 5am. That's her wake-up time. So, she's up and about starting at 5am.

Next, Lisa saw Jennifer buying a bike at the bike shop from 5am to 10am. So, between 5am and 10am, Jennifer is at the bike shop. That means she's not at the amusement park during this time.

Then, Samantha saw Jennifer taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 2pm. So, from 10am to 2pm, Jennifer is near the Eiffel Tower. She's not at the amusement park during these hours.

After that, William saw Jennifer waiting at the airport from 2pm to 3pm. So, between 2pm and 3pm, she's at the airport. Not at the amusement park.

Ashley saw Jennifer buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 5pm. So, from 4pm to 5pm, she's at the deli. Not at the amusement park.

Andrew saw Jennifer working at the office from 5pm to 8pm. So, from 5pm to 8pm, she's at the office. The amusement park was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone there during this time either.

Now, let's look at the times when Jennifer is not seen by anyone:

- From 5am to 10am: At the bike shop.
- 10am to 2pm: At the Eiffel Tower.
- 2pm to 3pm: At the airport.
- 4pm to 5pm: At the deli.
- 5pm to 8pm: At the office.

So, the times when Jennifer is free and could possibly go to the amusement park are between the hours when she's not seen by anyone.

Looking at the timeline:

- From 3pm to 4pm: There's a gap here because the last activity before this is William seeing her at the airport until 3pm, and Ashley sees her buying lunch starting at 4pm. So, between 3pm and 4pm, Jennifer is free.

- Also, from 8pm onwards: The amusement park is closed after 8pm, so she couldn't go later than that.

So, the possible times Jennifer could have gone to the amusement park are:

1. 3pm to 4pm.
2. After 8pm, but the park is closed after 8pm, so no.

Therefore, the only possible time is between 3pm and 4pm.

Let's double-check to make sure there's no overlap or other activities:

- Before 3pm: She's at the airport until 3pm, then free until 4pm when she buys lunch.
- So, between 3pm and 4pm, she's free.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 3pm to 4pm, which is option (D).

The amusement park was closed after 8pm, so Jennifer could not have gone later than that. The only free time she had was between 3pm and 4pm.

**Answer:** (D) 3pm to 4pm
