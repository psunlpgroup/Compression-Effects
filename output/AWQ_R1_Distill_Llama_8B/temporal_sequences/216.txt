Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how the times overlap.

First, William wakes up at 7am. That's his earliest possible time.

Then, Lisa saw William on the rooftop from 9am to 11am. So, between 9am and 11am, he's not at the coffee shop because he's on the rooftop.

Next, Elizabeth saw William buying a bike at the bike shop from 11am to 1pm. So, from 11am to 1pm, he's at the bike shop, not the coffee shop.

Richard saw William working at the office from 1pm to 6pm. So, from 1pm to 6pm, he's busy at the office.

Andrew saw William waiting at the train station from 6pm to 10pm. So, from 6pm to 10pm, he's at the train station.

The coffee shop was closed after 10pm, so he couldn't have gone there after 10pm.

Now, let's see when William wasn't seen by anyone else. Between 7am and 9am, he was just waking up and not spotted by anyone else. Then, from 1pm to 6pm, he's at the office. After that, from 6pm to 10pm, he's at the train station. The coffee shop is only available before 10pm.

So, the only time William wasn't doing any of these activities is between 7am and 9am when he's just waking up, and between 10pm and his wake-up time the next day, but the coffee shop is closed after 10pm.

Wait, but the options don't include 7am to 9am. The options are:

(A) 11am to 1pm  
(B) 1pm to 6pm  
(C) 6pm to 10pm  
(D) 7am to 9am

So, the only time William could have gone to the coffee shop is between 7am and 9am when he wasn't doing anything else. That's option D.

But wait, the coffee shop was closed after 10pm, so he couldn't have gone after 10pm. But he could have gone earlier. So, the only available time is between 7am and 9am, which is option D.

Wait, but the timeline shows that the coffee shop was closed after 10pm, but it doesn't say when it closed. Maybe it was open before 10pm. So, William could have gone at any time before 10pm when he wasn't doing other things.

But looking at the times:

- 7am to 9am: only him waking up, so he could have gone then.

- 9am to 11am: on the rooftop.

- 11am to 1pm: buying a bike.

- 1pm to 6pm: at the office.

- 6pm to 10pm: at the train station.

So, the only time he wasn't doing anything else is between 7am and 9am. That's the only possible time he could have gone to the coffee shop.

So, the answer is D.
