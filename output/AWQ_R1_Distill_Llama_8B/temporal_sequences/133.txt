Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Elizabeth's Wake-Up Time:** She wakes up at 5am.

2. **Mark's Observation:** He saw Elizabeth buying a bike at the bike shop from 6am to 9am.

3. **Andrew's Observation:** He saw Elizabeth waiting at the airport from 9am to 10am.

4. **Susan's Observation:** She saw Elizabeth driving to the water park from 10am to 1pm.

5. **Leslie's Observation:** She saw Elizabeth waiting at the train station from 1pm to 2pm.

6. **Thomas's Observation:** He saw Elizabeth attending class at the school from 2pm to 6pm.

7. **Gas Station Closing Time:** The gas station was closed after 6pm.

**Determining Possible Times for Gas Station Visit:**

- Elizabeth left her house at 5am and went to the bike shop (6am-9am). After buying the bike, she went to the airport (9am-10am), then to the water park (10am-1pm). She was at the train station (1pm-2pm) and later at school (2pm-6pm).

- The gas station was closed after 6pm, so Elizabeth couldn't have gone after that.

- Therefore, the only possible time she could have gone to the gas station is between 5am and 6am, before she went to buy the bike.

**Checking the Options:**

- **(A) 5am to 6am:** This fits her schedule before she went to buy the bike.

- **(B) 2pm to 6pm:** The gas station was closed after 6pm, so she couldn't have gone then.

- **(C) 1pm to 2pm:** She was at the train station during this time, not at the gas station.

- **(D) 6am to 9am:** She was buying a bike during this time, not at the gas station.

Thus, the correct answer is **(A)**.
