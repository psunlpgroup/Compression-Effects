The Yongle Emperor lived during the early Ming Dynasty, specifically from 1402 to 1424. His reign saw significant developments in Chinese culture, including the establishment of the capital at Beijing.

The person to whom the edict was addressed is not explicitly named in the question, but it's implied to be someone of high authority or significance during that time.

To determine the number of miles of highways in the city where the Yongle Emperor greeted this person, we need to consider the historical context and the infrastructure of the time. However, historical records from that period do not provide specific details about highway mileages.

Therefore, based on the available information, it's not possible to determine the exact number of miles of highways in the city during the Yongle Emperor's reign.
