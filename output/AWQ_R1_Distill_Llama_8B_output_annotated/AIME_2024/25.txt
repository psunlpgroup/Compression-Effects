["initializing"]
Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in a specific triangle setup. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
First, the triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. So, ABC is a triangle whose all three vertices lie on the circumference of circle ω. That makes ω the circumcircle of triangle ABC.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Next, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Tangents to a circle from a common external point are equal in length, so BD equals CD. That might come in handy later.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line to D, and this line will meet the circle at another point P. My goal is to find the length of AP.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Given are the sides of triangle ABC: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. So, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Interesting, this is a scalene triangle.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
The problem asks for AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then to find m + n.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Alright, so let's start by visualizing or perhaps sketching the problem. I have triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω passes through A, B, C.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from D to ω at B and C, so D is the ex-tangent point.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Then, AD meets ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
I need to find AP.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Hmm, so perhaps I can use some theorems related to circles, power of a point, intersecting chords, or something like that.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Given that D is the intersection of the two tangents from D to ω, so D lies outside ω, and DB and DC are tangent to ω.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, by the Power of a Point theorem, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Also, the power of D is equal to DA * DP, since AD is a secant line intersecting ω at A and P.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, Power of D: DB^2 = DA * DP.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, if I can find DA and DP, maybe I can relate them.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, I don't know DA yet. Hmm, perhaps I can compute DA in terms of the triangle ABC.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can use triangle ABC to find the radius of ω or other properties.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
First, maybe compute some properties of triangle ABC: sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, so triangle ABC has sides 5,9,10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Sum of AB and BC: 5 + 9 = 14 > 10, so yes, it's a valid triangle.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Compute semi-perimeter: (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Compute area using Heron's formula: \(\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = \sqrt{12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)} = \sqrt{12 * 7 * 3 * 2} = \sqrt{504}\).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, 504 is 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Hmm, but 504 can be factored as 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, 504 is 16 * 31.5? No, 16 * 31.5 is 504, yes, but 31.5 is 63/2, so \(\sqrt{504} = \sqrt{16 * 63/2} = 4 \sqrt{63/2}\).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Hmm, maybe better to factor 504.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is 63/2, but perhaps 504 can be factored as 8 * 63, because 8*63 is 504.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So \(\sqrt{504} = \sqrt{8*63} = \sqrt{8}\sqrt{63} = 2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{9*7} = 2\sqrt{2}3\sqrt{7} = 6\sqrt{14}\).
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, that can't be because \(\sqrt{504}\) is approximately 22.45, and \(6\sqrt{14}\) is about 6*3.74=22.44, which is correct.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, area is \(6\sqrt{14}\).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Alternatively, using Heron's formula, the area is \(\sqrt{12*7*3*2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}\). Okay.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, area is \(6\sqrt{14}\).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Also, we can compute the circumradius \(R\) of triangle ABC using the formula:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area)
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Where a, b, c are the sides.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, a=5, b=9, c=10.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, R = (5*9*10)/(4*6\(\sqrt{14}\)) = (450)/(24\(\sqrt{14}\)) = (75)/(4\(\sqrt{14}\)).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Rationalizing the denominator: (75\(\sqrt{14}\))/(4*14) = (75\(\sqrt{14}\))/56.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, R = 75\(\sqrt{14}\) / 56.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Hmm, okay, so now we know the circumradius.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But how does that help us?
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the triangle.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (x, y), and point A at (10,0), since AC is 10.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, AB is 5, BC is 9, AC is 10.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, if I place point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0). Then point B is somewhere in the plane.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, distance from A to B is 5: so if A is at (10,0), then B is at (10 - 5*cos(theta), 0 + 5*sin(theta)) for some angle theta.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
But distance from B to C is 9, so point B is at (x,y) such that \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 9\), and \(\sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + y^2} = 5\).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
So, let's set up equations.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Distance from B to C: \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 9\), so \(x^2 + y^2 = 81\).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Distance from B to A: \(\sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + y^2} = 5\), so \((x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25\).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Subtracting the first equation from the second:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
(x - 10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Expanding (x - 10)^2: \(x^2 - 20x + 100\).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, x^2 -20x + 100 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = -56
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify: -20x + 100 = -56
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, -20x = -156
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, x = 7.8
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, x is 7.8, which is 39/5.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, x = 39/5, so then from x^2 + y^2 = 81:
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute (39/5)^2: (1521)/25
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, y^2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, y = \(\sqrt{504/25} = (\sqrt{504})/5 = (6\sqrt{14})/5\).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, point B is at (39/5, (6\(\sqrt{14}\))/5). So, coordinates:
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
C: (0,0)
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
A: (10,0)
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
B: (39/5, (6\(\sqrt{14}\))/5)
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Alright, so now I can compute the coordinates of all three points.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Now, the circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. So, with points A, B, C.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Given the coordinates, we can find the equation of ω.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps use the circumradius formula, which we did earlier: R = 75√14 / 56.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But maybe it's better to find the coordinates of the circumcircle.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that D is the ex-tangent point, so D is the external homothety center of the circle ω.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, but maybe let's compute coordinates of D.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Point D is the intersection of the two tangents from D to ω at points B and C.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so D is the external point from which two tangents can be drawn to ω, touching at B and C.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, D lies on the external tangent line, which is the radical axis or something? Wait, no, the radical axis is the set of points with equal power with respect to two circles.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Wait, but here, D is the external point, so the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Also, the line DC is tangent to ω at C, and DB is tangent at B.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, point D is the ex-tangent point, so it lies on the external tangent line.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps find coordinates of D.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Given points B and C, and the circle ω, we can find the coordinates of D as the ex-tangent point.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, since we have coordinates of B and C, and the circle passing through A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circle, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find the equation of line AD, find its intersection P with ω, then compute AP.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
This seems computational, but perhaps manageable.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Let me proceed step by step.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First, find the equation of the circumcircle ω.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Given three points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me write the general equation of a circle: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since the circle passes through C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So equation simplifies to x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Now, plug in point A(10,0):
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
10^2 + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 => 100 + 10D = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, equation becomes x^2 + y^2 -10x + Ey = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Now, plug in point B(39/5, 6√14/5):
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Compute each term:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
10*(39/5) = 78
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, equation becomes:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1521/25 + 504/25 - 78 + (6√14/5)E = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Compute 1521 + 504 = 2025, so 2025/25 = 81.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 81 - 78 + (6√14/5)E = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 3 + (6√14/5)E = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, (6√14/5)E = -3
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Multiply both sides by 5: 6√14 E = -15
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, E = -15/(6√14) = -5/(2√14) = (-5√14)/(28).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
E = (-5√14)/(28).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the equation of ω is x^2 + y^2 -10x + (-5√14/28)y = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Alternatively, writing it as:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x^2 + y^2 -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Alright, so equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Now, find the equations of the tangents from D to points B and C.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But wait, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, we can find equations of these tangents, then find their intersection D.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
The tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the equation: for a circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, the tangent at (x₁,y₁) is xx₁ + yy₁ + D(x + x₁)/2 + E(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Wait, but in our case, the circle equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, general equation is x² + y² + D x + E y + F = 0, where D = -10, E = -5√14 /28, F=0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the tangent at point B(x₁, y₁) is x x₁ + y y₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, tangent at point C(0,0) is x*0 + y*0 + D*(x + 0)/2 + E*(y + 0)/2 + F = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify tangent at C:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
0 + 0 + (-10)*(x)/2 + (-5√14 /28)*(y)/2 + 0 = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
-5x - (5√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Multiply both sides by -1:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
5x + (5√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, tangent at C is 5x + (5√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Similarly, tangent at B: Let me compute that.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). So, x₁ = 39/5, y₁ = 6√14/5.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Equation of tangent at B:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14 /28)*(y + 6√14/5)/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me compute each term step by step.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First term: (39/5)x
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Second term: (6√14/5)y
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Third term: (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 = (-10/2)*(x + 39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Fourth term: (-5√14 /28)*(y + 6√14/5)/2 = (-5√14 /28)*(y)/2 + (-5√14 /28)*(6√14/5)/2
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First part: (-5√14 /56)y
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Second part: (-5√14 /28)*(6√14 /5)/2 = (-5√14 * 6√14)/(28*5*2) = (-5*6*14)/(28*5*2) = (-6*14)/(28*2) = (-84)/(56) = -1.5 = -3/2.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, putting it all together:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 - (5√14 /56)y -3/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Now, let's combine like terms.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
x terms: (39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
y terms: (6√14/5)y - (5√14 /56)y = let's factor out √14 y:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
√14 y*(6/5 - 5/56) = √14 y*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) ) = √14 y*( (336 -25)/280 ) = √14 y*(311/280).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Constant terms: -39 - 3/2 = -39.5 or -79/2.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the equation becomes:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(14/5)x + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, tangent at B is (14/5)x + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
So, now we have the two tangent equations:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
1. Tangent at C: 5x + (5√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
2. Tangent at B: (14/5)x + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
We can solve these two equations to find the coordinates of D.
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Let me write them down:
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Equation 1: 5x + (5√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Equation 2: (14/5)x + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me try to solve these equations.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First, Equation 1 can be simplified:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Divide both sides by 5: x + (√14)/56 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, x = - (√14 /56) y.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, x = - (√14 /56) y.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me denote this as x = k y, where k = -√14 /56.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, x = k y.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Now, substitute x = k y into Equation 2.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Equation 2: (14/5)x + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Substitute x:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(14/5)(k y) + (311√14 /280)y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Factor out y:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
[ (14/5)k + 311√14 /280 ] y - 79/2 = 0.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus,
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
[ (14/5)(-√14 /56 ) + 311√14 /280 ] y = 79/2.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute the coefficients:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First term: (14/5)(-√14 /56 ) = (14)(-√14 )/(5*56) = (-14√14 )/(280) = (-√14 )/20.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Second term: 311√14 /280.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, total coefficient:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(-√14 /20) + (311√14 /280) = let's get a common denominator of 280.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(-14√14 /280) + (311√14 /280) = (297√14)/280.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, equation becomes:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(297√14 /280) y = 79/2.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, y = (79/2) / (297√14 /280) = (79/2) * (280)/(297√14).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
79/2 * 280/297√14.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify numerator and denominator:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First, 280 / 2 = 140, so 79 * 140 / (297√14).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 79 * 140: 79*140= 10, 79*14=1, 79*140= 1, 79*140= 1, 79*140=1, 79*140=1, no, wait, 140*79: 140*70=9800, 140*9=1260, so total 9800+1260=11,060.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 11,060 / (297√14).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Simplify numerator and denominator:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 11,060 /3=3,686.666..., which is not integer. Wait, 297 is divisible by 3: 297 /3=99.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, 11,060 ÷ 3: 11,060 /3= 3,686.666... Hmm, not integer. Alternatively, perhaps 297 and 11,060 have a common factor.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute GCD of 297 and 11,060.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
297 divides by 3: 297=3*99=3*9*11.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
11,060: let's factor it.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
11,060 ÷ 10=1,106.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,106 ÷ 2=553.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
553 ÷ 7=79.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
So, 11,060=10*2*7*79=20*7*79.

["example-testing"]
297=3^3 *11.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, no common factors with 11,060 except 1, since 79 is prime, and 297 has 3 and 11, which don't divide 11,060.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, fraction is 11,060 / (297√14). Maybe we can leave it as is for now.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, y = 11,060 / (297√14).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me compute 11,060 / 297:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
297*37= 297*30=8,910; 297*7=2,079; total=8,910+2,079=11,  so 297*37=11,  so 297*37=11,  297*37=11, (wait, 297*37=11, 297*30=8,910, 297*7=2,079; 8,910 + 2,079=11,  so 297*37=11,  297*37=11, 297*37=11, 297*37=11, 297*37=11, 297*37=11, no, wait, 297*37= (300 -3)*37=300*37 -3*37=11,100 -111=10,989.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, 297*37=10,989.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 11,060 /297= 11,060 /297= (10,989 +71)/297=37 +71/297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 11,060 /297=37 +71/297=37 + (71/297).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But 71 and 297: 297 ÷ 71=4.183... Not integer. So, 71 is prime, I think.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, y= [37 + 71/297]/√14= (37√14 +71/(297√14)).
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, not sure if this helps.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps rationalize the denominator:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
y= 11,060 / (297√14)= (11,060√14)/(297*14)= (11,060√14)/4,158.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Simplify 11,060 /4,158.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 5,530 /2,079.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Check if 5,530 and 2,079 have a common factor.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute GCD(5,530, 2,079).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Using Euclidean algorithm:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
5,530 ÷2,079=2 times, remainder 5,530 -2*2,079=5,530-4,158=1,372.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Now, GCD(2,079,1,372).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
2,079 ÷1,372=1 time, remainder 2,079 -1,372=707.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(1,372,707).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,372 ÷707=1 time, remainder 665.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(707,665).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
707 ÷665=1 time, remainder 42.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(665,42).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
665 ÷42=15 times, remainder 665 -15*42=665 -630=35.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(42,35).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
42 ÷35=1 time, remainder 7.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(35,7)=7.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, GCD is 7.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, 5,530 ÷7=790, 2,079 ÷7=297.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, y= (790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Simplify further: 790 and 297.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
297=99*3=9*11*3.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
790 ÷2=395, which is 5*79.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
297 ÷3=99=9*11.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
No common factors between 790 and 297 except 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, y= (790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, y= (790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Simplify 790/297: 790 ÷297=2 with remainder 790 -594=196.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, 790/297=2 +196/297.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But not helpful.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, y= (790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Then, x= k y= (-√14 /56)y= (-√14 /56)(790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x= (-√14 *790√14)/(56*297)= (-14*790)/(56*297).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Because √14 *√14=14.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, x= (-14*790)/(56*297).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify numerator and denominator:
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
14 divides into 56: 56=14*4.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, 14*790 / (14*4*297)=790/(4*297)=790/1,188.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify 790/1,188: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 395/594.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Check if 395 and 594 have common factors.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
395 ÷5=79, which is prime.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
594 ÷5=118.8, so no.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Check 395 and 594: 395=5*79, 594=2*3^3*11.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
No common factors, so x= -395/594.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, x= -395/594, y=790√14/297.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Simplify y:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
790 and 297: as before, 297=99*3=9*11*3, 790=10*79. No common factors.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, y= (790√14)/297.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Therefore, point D is at (-395/594, 790√14 /297).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, D is located at (-395/594, 790√14 /297).
["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Okay, so now we have coordinates of A, D.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Point A is at (10,0).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Point D is at (-395/594, 790√14 /297).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, to find the equation of line AD, we can compute the slope first.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute slope m_AD:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (790√14 /297 - 0)/( -395/594 -10).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify denominator:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
-395/594 -10= -395/594 - (10*594)/594= -395/594 -5,940/594= (-395 -5,940)/594= (-6,335)/594.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Simplify numerator:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
790√14 /297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, m_AD= (790√14 /297) / (-6,335 /594)= (790√14 /297)*( -594 /6,335).
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
790 and 6,335: Let's see, 6,335 ÷790= approx 8.05. Let me check 790*8=6,320, so 6,335 -6,320=15. So, 6,335=790*8 +15. Not divisible.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Similarly, 594 and 297: 594=2*297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, m_AD= (790√14 /297)*( -594 /6,335)= (790√14 /297)*( -594 /6,335).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Note that 594=2*297, so:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
m_AD= (790√14 /297)*( -2*297 /6,335)= (790√14 /297)*( -594 /6,335).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, that's the same as before.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, perhaps factor out:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Note that 594=2*297, so:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
m_AD= (790√14 /297)*( -2*297 /6,335)= (790√14 * (-2))/6,335= (-1,580√14)/6,335.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Simplify 1,580 and 6,335:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1,580 ÷5=316, 6,335 ÷5=1,267.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Check if 316 and 1,267 have common factors.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
316 ÷4=79, which is prime.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,267 ÷79= approx 16.07. 79*16=1,264, so 1,267-1,264=3. So, 1,267=79*16 +3, which is not divisible by 79.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, m_AD= (-316√14)/1,267.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, 316 and 1,267: 316 is 4*79, 1,267 is prime? Let me check 1,267 ÷13=97.3, no. 1,267 ÷7=181, no. 1,267 ÷11=115.18, no. So, likely co-prime.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, m_AD= (-316√14)/1,267.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, slope is -316√14 /1,267.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, the equation of AD is y -0= m_AD(x -10).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, y= (-316√14 /1,267)(x -10).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, y= (-316√14 /1,267)x + (3160√14)/1,267.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Now, we need to find point P where AD intersects ω again.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since A is on ω, P is the other intersection.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, we can solve the system of equations: the equation of ω and the equation of AD.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Equation of ω: x² + y² -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Equation of AD: y= (-316√14 /1,267)x + (3160√14)/1,267.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Substitute y from AD into ω equation.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me denote m = -316√14 /1,267, and c = 3160√14 /1,267.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, y= m x + c.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Substitute into ω equation:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x² + (m x + c)^2 -10x - (5√14)/28*(m x + c) = 0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
This will result in a quadratic equation in x.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
We know that x=10 is a solution (point A), so the other solution will give x_P, then y_P.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Let me compute this.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First, expand (m x + c)^2:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
= m² x² + 2 m c x + c².
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the equation becomes:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x² + m² x² + 2 m c x + c² -10x - (5√14)/28*(m x + c) = 0.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Combine like terms:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
(1 + m²)x² + (2 m c -10 - (5√14)/28 m) x + (c² - (5√14)/28 c) = 0.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Since x=10 is a root, we can factor (x -10), so the quadratic equation can be written as (x -10)(something)=0.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, use Vieta's formula: product of roots is c² - (5√14)/28 c divided by (1 + m²). But since one root is 10, the other root is (c² - (5√14)/28 c)/(10*(1 + m²)).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Wait, Vieta's formula says that if quadratic is a x² + b x + c =0, then sum of roots is -b/a, product is c/a.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
In our case, quadratic is (1 + m²)x² + (2 m c -10 - (5√14)/28 m)x + (c² - (5√14)/28 c)=0.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, sum of roots: -(2 m c -10 - (5√14)/28 m)/(1 + m²).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Product of roots: (c² - (5√14)/28 c)/(1 + m²).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Given that one root is 10, let me denote the other root as x_P.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 10 * x_P = (c² - (5√14)/28 c)/(1 + m²).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, x_P= [c² - (5√14)/28 c]/[10*(1 + m²)].
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, x_P= [c(c - (5√14)/28)]/[10*(1 + m²)].
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute c:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
c= 3160√14 /1,267.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Compute c - (5√14)/28:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
c - (5√14)/28= 3160√14 /1,267 -5√14 /28.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Factor out √14:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
√14*(3160/1,267 -5/28).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 3160/1,267:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
3160 ÷1,267= approx 2.5, exactly 3160=2*1580, 1,267 is prime? Wait, 1,267 ÷13=97.46, not integer. 1,267 ÷7=181, which is prime. So, 1,267 is prime?
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, 1,267 ÷17=74.52, not integer. So, yes, likely prime.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 3160/1,267= 3160 ÷1,267=2.5, because 1,267*2=2,534, 1,267*2.5=3,167.5. Wait, no, 1,267*2.5=3,167.5, but 3160 is less than that.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, wait, 1,267*2=2,534. 3160 -2,534=626. So, 3160/1,267=2 +626/1,267.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Similarly, 5/28= approx 0.1786.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, 3160/1,267 -5/28=2 +626/1,267 -5/28.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 626/1,267= approx 0.495.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 2 +0.495 -0.1786≈2.316.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But let's compute exact value.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 3160/1,267 -5/28.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Convert to common denominator: 1,267 and 28.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,267= prime? Wait, 1,267 ÷ 28=45.035, so not integer.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute LCM of 1,267 and 28: 1,267 is prime (I think), so LCM=1,267*28.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, 3160/1,267 -5/28= (3160*28 -5*1,267)/(1,267*28).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute numerator:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
3160*28: 3,000*28=84,000; 160*28=4,480; total=84,000 +4,480=88,480.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
5*1,267=6,335.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, numerator=88,480 -6,335=82,145.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, 3160/1,267 -5/28=82,145/(1,267*28)=82,145/35,396.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify 82,145 and 35,396:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(82,145,35,396).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Compute GCD(82,145,35,396).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Using Euclidean algorithm:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
82,145 ÷35,396=2 times, remainder 82,145 -2*35,396=82,145 -70,792=11,353.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Now, GCD(35,396,11,353).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
35,396 ÷11,353=3 times, remainder 35,396 -3*11,353=35,396 -34,059=1,337.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(11,353,1,337).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
11,353 ÷1,337=8 times, 1,337*8=10,696, remainder 11,353 -10,696=657.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(1,337,657).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,337 ÷657=2 times, remainder 1,337 -1,314=23.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(657,23).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
657 ÷23=28 times, remainder 657 -28*23=657 -644=13.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]

23 ÷13=1 time, remainder 10.

13 ÷10=1 time, remainder 3.
["end-section"]

GCD(10,3).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
10 ÷3=3 times, remainder 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(3,1)=1.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, GCD is 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, 82,145/35,396 cannot be simplified.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, c - (5√14)/28=82,145/(1,267*28)√14=82,145√14 /35,396.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, c(c - (5√14)/28)= [3160√14 /1,267] * [82,145√14 /35,396].
["end-section"]

35,396 -34,760=636.
["end-section"]

3160*636= too big. Maybe 3160 and 35,396 have a common factor.
["end-section"]

Thus, 35,396=4*8,849; 3160=4*790.
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Similarly, 82,145 and 1,267: check GCD.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
82,145 ÷1,267= approx65.1.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 1,267*65=82,555, which is greater than82,145. So, 1,267*65=82,555.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
82,145 -1,267*64=82,145 -81,248=897.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(1,267,897).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
1,267 ÷897=1 time, remainder 370.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(897,370).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
897 ÷370=2 times, remainder 157.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(370,157).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
370 ÷157=2 times, remainder 36.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(157,36).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
157 ÷36=4 times, remainder 13.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(36,13).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
36 ÷13=2 times, remainder 10.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(13,10).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
13 ÷10=1 time, remainder 3.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(10,3).
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
10 ÷3=3 times, remainder 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
GCD(3,1)=1.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, GCD is 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, 82,145 and1,267 have GCD 1.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, back to c(c - (5√14)/28)= (3160*82,145*14)/(1,267*35,396).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But we can write:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
c(c - (5√14)/28)= (3160*82,145*14)/(1,267*35,396)= (3160*82,145*14)/(1,267*35,396).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
But 35,396=4*8,849, 3160=4*790.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
So, 35,396=4*8,849, 3160=4*790.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, c(c - (5√14)/28)= (4*790 *82,145 *14)/(1,267*4*8,849)= (790*82,145 *14)/(1,267*8,849).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Simplify:
["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
790 and 8,849: 8,849 ÷790= approx11.23. Check if 790 divides 8,849.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
790*11=8,690, 8,849 -8,690=159. 790 doesn't divide 159 (since 159=3*53). So, no.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Similarly, 82,145 and1,267: as before, GCD 1.
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Thus, c(c - (5√14)/28)= (790*82,145 *14)/(1,267*8,849).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
This is getting too complex. Maybe there's a better approach.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, perhaps instead of computing all this, use inversion or some projective geometry, but that might be too complicated.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A, D, P, maybe compute AP using vector methods or distance formula.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
But given that P is on ω, and A is on ω, AP is a chord.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, but AP is a chord, and we can compute its length using properties of the circle.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps use the Power of a Point.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, point D has power DB^2=DA*DP.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, if I can compute DB, DA, and DP, maybe find DP in terms of DA.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But since I have coordinates, perhaps compute distances.
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Compute DA: distance between A(10,0) and D(-395/594, 790√14 /297).
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Compute DA:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
x difference: 10 - (-395/594)=10 +395/594= (5940 +395)/594=6335/594.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
y difference:0 -790√14 /297= -790√14 /297.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, DA= \(\sqrt{[(6335/594)^2 + (790\sqrt{14} /297)^2]}\).
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Similarly, compute DB: distance between D(-395/594, 790√14 /297) and B(39/5,6√14 /5).
["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Compute DB:
["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
x difference:39/5 - (-395/594)=39/5 +395/594.
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Convert to common denominator 594:
["end-section"]

["deduction"]
39/5= (39*118.8)/594= wait, 594 ÷5=118.8, so 39/5=39*118.8/594= but that's messy.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Alternatively, 39/5= (39*118.8)/594, but 118.8=594/5.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, no, better to compute 39/5 +395/594:
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Convert to common denominator 594:
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
39/5= (39*118.8)/594= 39*118.8=4,652.2/594≈7.8, but this is not helpful.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, perhaps compute numerically.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
39/5=7.8, 395/594≈0.664.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, 7.8 +0.664≈8.464.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Similarly, y difference:6√14 /5 -790√14 /297.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Compute 6/5 -790/297.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
6/5=1.2, 790/297≈2.656.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
So, 1.2 -2.656≈-1.456.
["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Thus, y difference≈-1.456√14.
["end-section"]

["7"]
Thus, DB≈\(\sqrt{[(8.464)^2 + (-1.456√14)^2]}\)≈\(\sqrt{[71.53 + (2.123)^2]}\)≈\(\sqrt{[71.53 +4.5]}\)≈\(\sqrt{[76.03]}\)≈8.72.
