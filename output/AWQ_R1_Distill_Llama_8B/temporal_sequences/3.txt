Alright, let's try to figure out when James could have gone to the beach. I'll start by listing out the information given and then see how it all fits together.

First, James woke up at 5am. So, any activities he did after waking up would be after that time.

Next, Sean saw James walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 5am to 6am. That means James was heading towards the Statue of Liberty during that hour.

Then, Michael saw James driving to the water park from 6am to 7am. So, right after Sean saw him, Michael saw him driving to the water park.

After that, Anthony saw James reading at the library from 7am to 3pm. So, James was at the library for a significant chunk of time, from 7am until 3pm.

William saw James getting a coffee at the cafe from 4pm to 9pm. That means after spending time at the library, James went to get a coffee, and he was there until 9pm.

The beach was closed after 9pm, which means James couldn't have gone to the beach after 9pm.

Now, let's piece this together.

James wakes up at 5am.

From 5am to 6am: James is walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

From 6am to 7am: James is driving to the water park.

From 7am to 3pm: James is reading at the library.

From 3pm to 4pm: Hmm, there's a gap here. After being at the library until 3pm, James could have gone somewhere else. Maybe he went to the beach during this time?

From 4pm to 9pm: James is getting a coffee at the cafe.

Since the beach was closed after 9pm, James couldn't have gone to the beach after 9pm.

So, the only possible time James could have gone to the beach is between 3pm and 4pm, before he went to get coffee.

Let me double-check:

- 5am to 6am: Statue of Liberty
- 6am to 7am: Water park
- 7am to 3pm: Library
- 3pm to 4pm: Beach
- 4pm to 9pm: Cafe

Yes, that fits.

So, James could have gone to the beach between 3pm and 4pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 7am to 3pm – No, James was at the library during this time.

(B) 5am to 6am – No, he was walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

(C) 4pm to 9pm – No, he was getting coffee during this time.

(D) 3pm to 4pm – Yes, this is the time he could have gone to the beach.

So, the correct answer is (D).
</think>

The correct answer is (D) 3pm to 4pm.

**Answer:** (D)
