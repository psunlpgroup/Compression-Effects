Alright, let's try to figure out between what times James could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll start by listing all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, James woke up at 7am. That's the earliest time we have.

Then, Elizabeth saw James waiting at the airport from 7am to 8am. So, James was at the airport during that time.

After that, Kimberly saw James reading at the library from 1pm to 3pm. So, between 1pm and 3pm, James was at the library.

Then, Ashley saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 3pm to 7pm. So, James was taking photos from 3pm to 7pm.

Next, Sean saw James stretching at a yoga studio from 7pm to 9pm. So, James was at the yoga studio during that time.

Finally, William saw James attending class at the school from 9pm to 10pm. So, James was in class from 9pm to 10pm.

It's also mentioned that the coffee shop was closed after 10pm. That might be important because if the coffee shop closed at 10pm, James couldn't have gone there after that time.

Now, let's see when James was free. We need to find the overlapping times when James wasn't occupied with other activities.

James was at the airport from 7am to 8am. Then, he was at the library from 1pm to 3pm. After that, he was taking photos from 3pm to 7pm. Then, at 7pm, he started stretching at the yoga studio until 9pm. Finally, he was in class from 9pm to 10pm.

Looking at these times:

- 7am to 8am: Airport
- 8am to 1pm: Free? Wait, no. After 8am, he was at the airport until 8am, but the next activity starts at 1pm. So, from 8am to 1pm, is he free?

Wait, let me clarify:

- 7am to 8am: Airport
- 8am to 1pm: Free?
- 1pm to 3pm: Library
- 3pm to 7pm: Eiffel Tower photos
- 7pm to 9pm: Yoga
- 9pm to 10pm: Class

So, between 8am and 1pm, James was free. That's a significant window.

Also, from 3pm to 7pm, he was taking photos, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop then.

From 7pm to 9pm, he was at yoga, so no coffee shop during that time.

From 9pm to 10pm, he was in class.

The coffee shop was closed after 10pm, so he couldn't have gone after 10pm.

So, the only free time he had was from 8am to 1pm.

Wait, but let me double-check:

- 7am to 8am: Airport
- 8am to 1pm: Free
- 1pm to 3pm: Library
- 3pm to 7pm: Eiffel Tower
- 7pm to 9pm: Yoga
- 9pm to 10pm: Class

Yes, so 8am to 1pm is the only window he was free.

So, the answer should be (C) 8am to 1pm.

But wait, let me check the options again:

Options:
(A) 9pm to 10pm
(B) 7pm to 9pm
(C) 8am to 1pm
(D) 3pm to 7pm

Yes, (C) is 8am to 1pm, which matches my conclusion.

I think that's correct.

Between 8am and 1pm, James was free and could have gone to the coffee shop. 

The correct answer is (C).

**Answer: (C)**
