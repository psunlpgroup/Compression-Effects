To determine the possible times John could have visited the art studio, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **John's schedule:**
   - Woke up at **6am**.
   - **Thomas** saw John at the library from **7am to 3pm**.
   - **Lisa** saw John taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from **3pm to 9pm**.
   - **Steven** saw John buying cookies at a bakery from **9pm to 10pm**.
   - The **art studio was closed after 10pm**.

2. **Key observations:**
   - John was at the library from 7am to 3pm.
   - After leaving the library, John was taking photos from 3pm to 9pm.
   - He then bought cookies from 9pm to 10pm.
   - The art studio was closed after 10pm, meaning John couldn't have visited the art studio after 10pm.

3. **Possible time windows for the art studio:**
   - **Between 6am and 7am:** John was likely still at home or traveling, as he was seen at the library starting at 7am.
   - **Between 3pm and 9pm:** John was occupied with taking photos and buying cookies, so it's unlikely he visited the art studio during this time.
   - **Between 9pm and 10pm:** Steven saw John buying cookies, and the art studio was closed after 10pm, so John likely couldn't have visited the art studio during this time.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The only feasible time John could have visited the art studio is **between 6am and 7am** when he was traveling or before he started his activities for the day.
