Alright, so let's try to figure out between what times Sean could have gone to the art show. Sean's day seems pretty busy, and we have several people who saw him at different places at different times. Let's lay out all the information step by step.

First, Sean woke up at 7am. That's the earliest time we know about his day.

Then, Elizabeth saw Sean fixing their computer at the electronic store from 7am to 11am. So, Sean was at the electronic store during that time.

Next, Anthony saw Sean waiting at the airport from 11am to 2pm. So, after finishing at the electronic store, Sean went to the airport, where he was waiting from 11am to 2pm.

After that, Tiffany saw Sean waiting at the train station from 2pm to 3pm. So, from the airport, Sean moved to the train station, where he stayed until 3pm.

Then, Andrew saw Sean buying a bike at the bike shop from 4pm to 8pm. So, after the train station, Sean went to the bike shop, where he stayed until 8pm.

The art show was closed after 8pm, which is the latest time we have.

So, let's piece this together:

- **7am to 11am**: Electronic Store
- **11am to 2pm**: Airport
- **2pm to 3pm**: Train Station
- **4pm to 8pm**: Bike Shop

The art show was closed after 8pm, so Sean couldn't have gone to the art show after 8pm.

Now, let's see when Sean was free. He was occupied from 7am to 11am, then from 11am to 2pm, then from 2pm to 3pm, and finally from 4pm to 8pm.

So, when was Sean free?

Between 3pm and 4pm, Sean was likely at the train station until 3pm and then moved to the bike shop by 4pm. So, there's a small window between 3pm and 4pm where Sean might have been free before going to the bike shop.

Wait, but let's double-check:

- **7am to 11am**: Electronic Store
- **11am to 2pm**: Airport
- **2pm to 3pm**: Train Station
- **4pm to 8pm**: Bike Shop

So, from 3pm to 4pm, Sean was transitioning from the train station to the bike shop. It's possible that he was free for a short time during that overlap.

Alternatively, if we consider that Sean was at the train station until 3pm and then immediately went to the bike shop starting at 4pm, there's no time in between. So, maybe the window is actually from 3pm to 4pm when he was moving from the train station to the bike shop.

Therefore, Sean could have gone to the art show between 3pm and 4pm.

Let me check the options:

(A) 3pm to 4pm

(B) 7am to 11am

(C) 4pm to 8pm

(D) 11am to 2pm

Yes, option A fits the time when Sean was free and could have gone to the art show.

**Answer**
The correct answer is (A) 3pm to 4pm, so the index is A.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
