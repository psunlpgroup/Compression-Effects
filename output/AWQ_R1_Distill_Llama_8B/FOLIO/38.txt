Okay, let's try to figure out whether the conclusion that Beethoven is not a conductor is true or false based on the given premises. 

First, I'll list out the premises again to make sure I have them all straight:

1. Symphony No. 9 is a music piece.
2. Composers write music pieces.
3. Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.
4. Vienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.
5. Vienna Music Society is an orchestra.
6. Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.
7. Orchestras are led by conductors.

The conclusion is: Beethoven is not a conductor.

So, I need to see if the premises logically lead to this conclusion.

Starting with premise 6: Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society. From premise 5, Vienna Music Society is an orchestra. So, Beethoven leads an orchestra. Now, premise 7 says that orchestras are led by conductors. So, if Beethoven is leading the orchestra, that implies he is the conductor.

But wait, the conclusion says Beethoven is not a conductor. That seems contradictory. Let me check each step again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Premise 6: Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society. Since the Vienna Music Society is an orchestra (premise 5), that means Beethoven is a conductor because orchestras are led by conductors (premise 7). Therefore, Beethoven must be a conductor.

So, the conclusion that Beethoven is not a conductor would be false because the premises directly state that he leads the orchestra, which requires him to be a conductor.

I don't see any premises that would contradict this. The only thing that might be tricky is if there's a possibility that Beethoven could have another role, but the premises given don't mention any other roles for him related to the orchestra. They specifically say he leads the orchestra, which is the conductor's job.

Therefore, the conclusion that Beethoven is not a conductor is false based on the premises provided.

**Answer:** The conclusion that Beethoven is not a conductor is false. The premises establish that Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society, an orchestra, which is led by a conductor. Therefore, Beethoven must be a conductor, making the conclusion incorrect.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 5 & 6:** Vienna Music Society is an orchestra, and Beethoven leads it.
2. **Premise 7:** Orchestras are led by conductors.
3. **Conclusion from above premises:** Beethoven, as the leader of the orchestra, is a conductor.
4. **Conclusion Statement:** Claims Beethoven is not a conductor.
5. **Logical Deduction:** The premises directly contradict the conclusion, proving it false.

**Final Determination:** The conclusion is false.
