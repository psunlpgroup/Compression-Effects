["initializing"]Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The person who takes the last token wins.["end-section"]

["initializing"]I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Hmm, sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]I remember something about winning and losing positions.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Let me start by analyzing smaller values of n to see if I can find a pattern.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Let's denote a position as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player whose turn it is.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, if a position is W, the current player can force a win; if it's L, the current player will lose no matter what they do.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Starting from n=0: If there are no tokens, the player can't make a move, so that's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, 0 is L.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, 1 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who will then take it and win. Alternatively, the current player can't take 4 tokens because there aren't enough.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, the only move is to take 1, leaving 1. Since the opponent can win from 1, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So, 2 is L.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, is that right? If n=2, the player takes 1, leaving 1, which is a W position for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=3: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. Since the opponent is now in a losing position, the current player can force a win. So, n=3 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=5: Let's see. If the current player takes 1, they leave 4, which is W for the opponent. If they take 4, they leave 1, which is W for the opponent as well. So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. Therefore, n=5 is L.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, is that correct? If n=5, taking 1 leaves 4, which is a W for the opponent. Taking 4 leaves 1, which is also W for the opponent. So, the current player cannot leave the opponent in an L position, so n=5 is L.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=6: The current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L for the opponent). So, the current player can force a win by taking 1, leaving 5, which is L. So, n=6 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=7: The current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 3 (W for the opponent). So, the current player cannot leave the opponent in an L position. So, n=7 is L.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, hold on. If n=7, taking 1 leaves 6, which is W for the opponent, and taking 4 leaves 3, which is also W for the opponent. So, the current player can't force a loss on the opponent. Therefore, n=7 is L.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=8: The current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L for the opponent). So, n=8 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=9: The current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 5 (L for the opponent). So, the current player can choose to take 4, leaving 5, which is L for the opponent. Therefore, n=9 is W.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, is that right? If n=9, taking 4 leaves 5, which is L. So, the current player can force a win by taking 4. So, n=9 is W.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=10: The current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 6 (W for the opponent). So, the current player can't force a loss on the opponent. So, n=10 is L.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Hmm, so the pattern so far is: n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 result: L W L W W L W L W W L So, L positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,...["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait, let me list them: 0: L 1: W 2: L 3: W 4: W 5: L 6: W 7: L 8: W 9: W 10: L Hmm, so the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,...["end-section"]

["deduction"]Looking at the differences between these losing positions: From 0 to 2: +2 From 2 to 5: +3 From 5 to 7: +2 From 7 to 10: +3 ["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, alternates between adding 2 and 3? Hmm, that seems like a possible pattern.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, starting from 0, add 2 to get 2, add 3 to get 5, add 2 to get 7, add 3 to get 10, and so on.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the losing positions are numbers that can be expressed as 2 + 3k or 5 + 3k?["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, let's see.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,... Wait, 0: starting point 2: 0 + 2 5: 2 + 3 7: 5 + 2 10: 7 + 3 12: 10 + 2 15: 12 + 3 17: 15 + 2 20: 17 + 3["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5?["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, 0,5,10,15,20,... which are multiples of 5. But wait, 2 and 7 are not multiples of 5. Hmm.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Wait, maybe another way: Let me check modulo 5.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]n=0: 0 mod 5 = 0: L n=1: 1: W n=2: 2: L n=3: 3: W n=4: 4: W n=5: 0: L n=6: 1: W n=7: 2: L n=8: 3: W n=9: 4: W n=10: 0: L n=11: 1: W n=12: 2: L n=13: 3: W n=14: 4: W n=15: 0: L ["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5?["end-section"]

["deduction"]Because 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...["end-section"]

["deduction"]Wait, 0 mod 5: 0,5,10,15,20,... 2 mod 5: 2,7,12,17,22,...["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, yes, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5, it's a losing position for the current player.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Therefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, he needs n to be a losing position for Alice, meaning n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]But wait, Bob is the second player. So, if n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]So, how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Total numbers: 2024. Number of numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404.8, so 404 numbers. Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: same count, 404 or 405?["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404 full groups of 5, with 4 remaining numbers.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Numbers ≡0 mod5: 404 numbers (5,10,...,2020) Numbers ≡2 mod5: starting at 2,7,12,..., up to <=2024.["end-section"]

["deduction"]What is the last number ≤2024 in this sequence?["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the last number ≡2 mod5 is 2024 - (2024 mod5 -2).["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, maybe better to compute.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]The sequence is 2,7,12,..., let's find the maximum n ≡2 mod5 ≤2024.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]Compute 2024 ÷5=404 with remainder 4.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, the largest number ≤2024 and ≡2 mod5 is 5*404 +2=2022.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]So, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Number of terms: Let's compute.["end-section"]

["deduction"]It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 2, common difference 5.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, 2022-2=2020, which is 5*404, so 404 intervals, 405 terms.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: 5,10,...,2020. 2020=5*404, so number of terms is 404.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Therefore, total numbers ≡0 or 2 mod5: 404 +405=809.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait, but let me check n=0: is that considered? The problem says positive integers, so n=0 is excluded.["end-section"]

["example-testing"]But in our earlier analysis, n=0 is L, but n starts at 1.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, when counting numbers ≡0 or 2 mod5 from n=1 to n=2024, we have to subtract 1 if 0 is included.["end-section"]

["deduction"]But 0 isn't positive, so the count remains 809.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Wait, 2024 numbers from 1 to2024. Numbers ≡0 mod5: from 5 to2020, which is 404 numbers. Numbers ≡2 mod5: from2 to2022, which is 405 numbers.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Total: 404+405=809.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, yes, 809 numbers.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Therefore, the answer is 809.["end-section"]
