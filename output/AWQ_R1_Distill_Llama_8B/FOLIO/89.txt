Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the premise says that books contain tons of knowledge. That makes sense because books are usually written by knowledgeable people and compiled in a structured way. So, the first premise is solid.

Next, the premise states that when a person reads a book, they gain knowledge. This seems logical. Reading is a way to absorb information, learn new things, and expand one's understanding. So, the second point is also true.

Then, it says if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. This is a bit of a value judgment, but generally, gaining knowledge does lead to increased intelligence or the ability to make smarter decisions. So, that's a reasonable statement.

Now, the conclusion is that a smarter person has gained knowledge. Wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think. The original statements are in a chain: Books have knowledge, reading them makes you gain knowledge, which makes you smarter. So, the conclusion is Harry becoming smarter because he read a book.

But hold on, does reading a book always make someone smarter? I mean, it depends on the book and the person's understanding. If the book is about a complicated topic and the person can't grasp it, maybe they won't gain much. But assuming the book is accessible and the person can understand it, then yes, they gain knowledge and become smarter.

So, in Harry's case, he read "Walden," which is a book by Thoreau. I know Walden is about philosophy, nature, and life, so it's a deep book. If Harry can engage with it and absorb its content, he would gain knowledge. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that he's become smarter.

I don't see any flaws in the logic here. Each step follows from the previous one without any contradictions. So, the conclusion should be true.

The conclusion is **True**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - **Books contain tons of knowledge.** This is a factual statement about the nature of books.
   - **Reading a book leads to gaining knowledge.** This is a logical consequence of the first premise.
   - **Gaining knowledge leads to becoming smarter.** This is a reasonable inference based on the second point.

2. **Conclusion Evaluation:**
   - **A smarter person has gained knowledge.** This is directly inferred from the chain of premises. Since Harry read a book, he gained knowledge, and thus, he became smarter.

3. **Logical Flow:**
   - The premises are connected in a cause-and-effect relationship, making the conclusion valid.

4. **Considerations:**
   - While individual experiences with reading can vary, the premise presents a general case where gaining knowledge leads to increased intelligence. Thus, the conclusion holds under the given premises.

**Answer:** The conclusion is true.
