Alright, let's try to figure out when Jessica could have gone to the restaurant. So, Jessica woke up at 6am, and then there are a few different people who saw her at different times and places. Let's break it down step by step.

First, Lisa saw Jessica waiting at the train station from 6am to 12pm. So, that means from when Jessica woke up at 6am until noon, she was at the train station.

Then, Linda saw Jessica getting a coffee at the cafe from 12pm to 2pm. So, after Lisa saw her at the train station, Jessica moved to the cafe around noon and stayed there until 2pm.

After that, Sarah saw Jessica walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 2pm to 6pm. So, Jessica left the cafe after 2pm and started walking towards the Statue of Liberty, where Sarah saw her.

Now, the restaurant was closed after 7pm. So, if the restaurant was closed after 7pm, that means it was probably open before 7pm. So, the latest time Jessica could have gone to the restaurant would be before 7pm.

Let's look at the options provided:

(A) 6pm to 7pm  
(B) 6am to 12pm  
(C) 12pm to 2pm  
(D) 2pm to 6pm  

From the information given, Jessica was at the train station until 12pm, then at the cafe until 2pm, and then walking until 6pm. The restaurant was closed after 7pm, so the restaurant must have been open during the time when Jessica was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, which is from 2pm to 6pm.

Therefore, the possible time when Jessica could have gone to the restaurant is between 2pm and 6pm.

But wait, let's double-check. The restaurant was closed after 7pm, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was only closed after 7pm. It could have been closed at 7pm or earlier. So, if the restaurant was closed after 7pm, that might mean it was open up until 7pm. So, the latest time Jessica could have gone is before 7pm.

Given that, the 2pm to 6pm window includes the time when the restaurant was likely open, so option (D) 2pm to 6pm is the correct choice.

But hold on, let's make sure we're not missing anything. The problem says "Between what times could they have gone?" So, it's not necessarily the exact time, but the possible window when the restaurant was open and when Jessica was in the area.

Since the restaurant was closed after 7pm, it was open before 7pm. So, any time between 2pm and 7pm, but considering where Jessica was, she was walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 2pm to 6pm. So, the restaurant could have been open during that time.

Therefore, the best possible answer is (D) 2pm to 6pm.
</think>

The restaurant was closed after 7pm, meaning it was open before 7pm. Jessica was walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 2pm to 6pm, so the restaurant could have been open during that time.

**Answer:** (D) 2pm to 6pm
