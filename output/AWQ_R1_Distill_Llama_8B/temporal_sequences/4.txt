Alright, let's try to figure out when Jason could have gone to the movies. So, Jason woke up at 10 am. Then, Linda saw him getting coffee from 10 am to 3 pm. That means between 10 am and 3 pm, Jason was at the cafe. So, if he went to the movies, it couldn't be during that time because he was already at the cafe.

Next, Jennifer saw Jason walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6 pm to 7 pm. So, he was heading that way during that time. Then, Sean saw him buying a phone at the electronics store from 7 pm to 10 pm. That means from 7 pm to 10 pm, he was at the store.

The movies was closed after 10 pm, so he couldn't have gone to the movies after 10 pm.

Looking at the options:
- (A) 3 pm to 6 pm: He was at the cafe until 3 pm and then moving towards the Statue of Liberty. So, he wasn't free to go to the movies during this time.
- (B) 10 am to 3 pm: He was getting coffee, so no.
- (C) 7 pm to 10 pm: He was buying a phone, so no.
- (D) 6 pm to 7 pm: He was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so no.

Wait, none of these times seem possible because he was occupied elsewhere. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

He was at the cafe from 10 am to 3 pm, then moving towards the statue from 6 to 7 pm, and then buying a phone from 7 pm to 10 pm. So, the only free time he had was between 3 pm to 6 pm, right? But wait, Linda saw him at the cafe until 3 pm, and then Jennifer saw him at 6 pm. So, the time between 3 pm to 6 pm, he could have gone to the movies.

So, the correct answer should be (A) 3 pm to 6 pm.

Jason could have gone to the movies between 3 pm and 6 pm.

**Answer: (A)**
