Okay, so I need to figure out if Tom is a grumpy person based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down each premise one by one and see how they connect.

First premise: No one nice to animals is also mean to animals. Hmm, that means if someone is nice to animals, they can't be mean to them. So, being nice and mean to animals are mutually exclusive traits. That makes sense because if you're nice, you wouldn't be mean, right?

Second premise: Some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, grumpy people can sometimes be mean to animals. That's a specific case, not a general rule. Not all grumpy people are mean to animals, but at least some are.

Third premise: All animal lovers are nice to animals. So, if someone loves animals, they are nice to them. That's a given. It's like saying if you like something, you're kind towards it.

Fourth premise: All pet owners love animals. So, if someone owns a pet, they must love animals. That makes sense because owning a pet usually involves some level of care and affection.

Now, the conclusion is that Tom is a grumpy person. Let's see how that connects. Tom is a pet owner, so from the fourth premise, he must love animals. If he loves animals, then from the third premise, he's nice to animals.

But wait, the first premise says that if someone is nice to animals, they aren't mean to them. So, if Tom is nice to animals, he can't be mean to them. Now, looking at the second premise, some grumpy people are mean to animals. But Tom isn't mean to animals because he's nice to them. So, Tom can't be a grumpy person because grumpy people can be mean to animals, but Tom isn't mean to them.

Wait, but the second premise only says some grumpy people are mean to animals. It doesn't say all grumpy people are mean to animals. So, being grumpy doesn't necessarily mean you're mean to animals, but some are. However, Tom isn't mean to animals, so he can't be one of those grumpy people who are mean to animals. Therefore, Tom isn't grumpy.

So, putting it all together: Tom is a pet owner, so he loves animals and is nice to them. Since he's nice, he can't be mean, so he can't be grumpy (as some grumpy people are mean). Therefore, Tom isn't grumpy. So, the conclusion that Tom is grumpy is false.
