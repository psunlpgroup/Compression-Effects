Alright, let's try to figure out when Samantha could have gone to the bakery. I'll go through the information step by step.

First, Samantha wakes up at 6am. That means her day starts at 6am. Then, Sarah saw her walking in the garden from 6am to 11am. So, between 6am and 11am, Sarah spotted Samantha.

Next, Sean saw Samantha taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 12pm to 1pm. So, after 11am, at 12pm, Sean saw her there. That means she was there from 12pm to 1pm.

Then, Jason saw her taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm. So, right after the Leaning Tower, she went to the Eiffel Tower and was there from 1pm to 2pm.

After that, Elizabeth saw her walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 2pm to 3pm. So, she continued her activities into the afternoon, moving from the Eiffel Tower to the Statue of Liberty.

Then, Tiffany saw Samantha buying lunch at the deli from 3pm to 9pm. That means she was busy from 3pm until 9pm.

Now, the bakery was closed after 9pm. So, the latest she could have gone to the bakery would be before 9pm.

Let's piece this together. She was seen by Sarah from 6am to 11am, Sean from 12pm to 1pm, Jason from 1pm to 2pm, Elizabeth from 2pm to 3pm, and Tiffany from 3pm to 9pm.

Looking at these times, the periods when she was definitely not at the bakery are:

- 6am to 11am (Sarah saw her)
- 12pm to 1pm (Sean saw her)
- 1pm to 2pm (Jason saw her)
- 2pm to 3pm (Elizabeth saw her)
- 3pm to 9pm (Tiffany saw her)

Wait, that covers the entire timeline from 6am to 9pm. That means Samantha was always visible to others during these times, so she couldn't have gone to the bakery because she was occupied elsewhere.

But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking between what times she could have gone. Maybe there are gaps between these observations.

Let me check the timeline again:

- 6am to 11am: Sarah saw her
- 12pm to 1pm: Sean saw her
- 1pm to 2pm: Jason saw her
- 2pm to 3pm: Elizabeth saw her
- 3pm to 9pm: Tiffany saw her

There's a small window between 11am and 12pm where she might not have been seen by anyone. That's a 1-hour gap. So, between 11am and 12pm, she might have gone to the bakery.

Similarly, between 3pm and 9pm, she was buying lunch, so she couldn't have gone to the bakery during that time.

So, the only possible time she could have gone is between 11am and 12pm.

Wait, but the options are:

(A) 1pm to 2pm
(B) 11am to 12pm
(C) 3pm to 9pm
(D) 6am to 11am

So, the correct answer is (B) 11am to 12pm.

But earlier, I thought she was seen by Sarah until 11am, then Sean from 12pm. So, between 11am and 12pm, she wasn't seen by anyone, so she could have gone to the bakery.

So, yes, the answer should be (B) 11am to 12pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (B) 11am to 12pm.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Samantha was seen by Sarah from 6am to 11am.
2. Sean saw her from 12pm to 1pm.
3. There's a 1-hour gap between 11am and 12pm when Samantha wasn't observed.
4. During this gap, she could have visited the bakery.
5. The other options either overlap with times when she was seen by others or are after she was last observed before 9pm, when the bakery was closed.

Answer: (B) 11am to 12pm
