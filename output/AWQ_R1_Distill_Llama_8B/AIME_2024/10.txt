Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if \( |z| = r \), then \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = r e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Since \( |z| = 4 \) here, \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \). That might be useful later.

Now, the expression given is \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]. I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it. Let me denote this expression as \( E \), so:

\( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Since \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), let me express \( z \) as \( 4 e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\( E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the constants separately:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 75 \cdot 4 + 117i \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \).

So, substituting back:

\( E = (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, okay. So now, \( E \) is expressed in terms of \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \). Maybe I can write this in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \) to compute the real part.

Let me recall Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos \theta - i \sin \theta \).

So, let me compute each term:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \).

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos \theta - i \sin \theta) \).

I need to compute the real part of \( E \), so I can just compute the real parts of each term and sum them.

Let me compute the first term's real part:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \).

Multiplying this out:

= \( 300 \cos \theta + 300i \cos \theta + 468i \cos \theta + 468i^2 \sin \theta \).

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

= \( 300 \cos \theta + i(300 \cos \theta + 468 \cos \theta) + 468(-\sin \theta) \).

Wait, actually, let me re-express this properly.

Wait, actually, more accurately:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \) = \( 300 \cos \theta + 300i \cos \theta + 468i \cos \theta + 468i^2 \sin \theta \).

Simplify:

= \( 300 \cos \theta + i(300 \cos \theta + 468 \cos \theta) + 468(-1) \sin \theta \).

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem quite right.

Wait, actually, when multiplying two complex numbers, the real part is the sum of the products of the real parts, and the imaginary part is the sum of the cross terms.

Wait, actually, more accurately:

If \( (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \).

So, applying this formula:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \).

So, \( a = 300 \), \( b = 468 \), \( c = \cos \theta \), \( d = \sin \theta \).

Thus, real part = \( (300 \cdot \cos \theta - 468 \cdot \sin \theta) \).

Imaginary part = \( (300 \cdot \sin \theta + 468 \cdot \cos \theta) \).

Similarly, for the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos \theta - i \sin \theta) \).

Again, using the same formula:

\( a = 24 \), \( b = 36 \), \( c = \cos \theta \), \( d = -\sin \theta \).

Real part = \( (24 \cdot \cos \theta - 36 \cdot (-\sin \theta)) = 24 \cos \theta + 36 \sin \theta \).

Imaginary part = \( (24 \cdot (-\sin \theta) + 36 \cdot \cos \theta) = -24 \sin \theta + 36 \cos \theta \).

So, now, let's write out the real parts:

First term's real part: \( 300 \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta \).

Second term's real part: \( 24 \cos \theta + 36 \sin \theta \).

Therefore, the total real part of \( E \) is:

\( 300 \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta + 24 \cos \theta + 36 \sin \theta \).

Simplify:

= \( (300 + 24) \cos \theta + (-468 + 36) \sin \theta \).

= \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \).

So, the real part of \( E \) is \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \). I need to find the maximum value of this expression.

Hmm, okay. So, essentially, I have a linear combination of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \), which can be expressed as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \) or something like that.

Yes, indeed, expressions of the form \( a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \tan \phi = \frac{b}{a} \). So, the maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), because the maximum of \( \cos \) is 1.

Therefore, the maximum of \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \) is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that:

First, \( 324^2 = 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400, plus 576 is 105, 976? Wait, 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 105, 976? Wait, 104400 + 576 is 105, 976? Wait, 104400 + 500 is 104900, plus 76 is 104976. So, yes, 324 squared is 104976.

Similarly, \( (-432)^2 = 432^2. Let's compute 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, and cross term 2*400*32=25600. So, 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 = 185600, plus 1024 is 186,624.

Therefore, \( R = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} \).

Compute 104976 + 186624: 104,976 + 186,624. Let's add 100,000 + 100,000 = 200,000. Then, 4,976 + 86,624: 4,976 + 86,624 = 91,600. So total is 200,000 + 91,600 = 291,600.

Therefore, \( R = \sqrt{291600} \). Hmm, let me compute sqrt(291600). Let's see, 500^2 = 250,000. 600^2=360,000. So sqrt(291,600) is between 500 and 600. Let's see:

Let me factor 291,600:

Divide by 100: 2916.

Now, 2916 divided by 4 is 729. 729 is 27 squared, which is 9^3.

So, 2916 = 4 * 729 = 4 * 9^3.

Therefore, sqrt(2916) = sqrt(4 * 9^3) = 2 * 9 * sqrt(9) = 2 * 9 * 3 = 54.

Therefore, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * sqrt(100) = 54 * 10 = 540.

Therefore, \( R = 540 \). So, the maximum value of \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \) is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part of \( E \) is 540.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 324 squared is 104,976, and 432 squared is 186,624. Adding those gives 291,600. Square root is 540. That seems correct.

But wait, 324 and 432 are coefficients in front of cosine and sine. So, the expression is like \( a \cos \theta + b \sin \theta \), where \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \).

But in the formula, the maximum is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), regardless of the sign of \( b \). So, yes, it's 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this expression \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \) indeed has a maximum of 540?

Yes, because the amplitude is the square root of the sum of squares of coefficients, so that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a dot product of the vector \( (324, -432) \) with the vector \( (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \). The maximum value of the dot product is the product of the magnitudes, which is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \times \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} \) = \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \times 1 \) = 540. So, that makes sense.

Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider \( z \) as \( 4 e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). So, then \( E = (75 + 117i) z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Let me write \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \). Then, \( E = A z + \frac{B}{z} \).

Given that \( |z| = 4 \), so \( z \overline{z} = |z|^2 = 16 \), so \( \overline{z} = \frac{16}{z} \). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express \( E \) as \( A z + \frac{B}{z} \), and then write this as \( A z + \frac{B}{z} \). Maybe I can set \( w = z \), so \( |w| = 4 \), and then \( E = A w + \frac{B}{w} \).

Then, to maximize the real part of \( E \). Hmm, but I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can consider \( E \) as a function of \( \theta \), then take the derivative with respect to \( \theta \), set it to zero, and find the maximum.

But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps treat \( E \) as a function on the circle \( |z| = 4 \), parameterized by \( \theta \), and then find its maximum.

But I think the first approach is sufficient.

Wait, another point: since \( |z| = 4 \), \( \overline{z} = \frac{16}{z} \). So, perhaps I can write \( E \) in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \).

But \( E = (75 + 117i) z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Let me write \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). So, \( E = (75 + 117i) z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Wait, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps write \( E = A z + \frac{B}{z} \), where \( A = 75 + 117i \), \( B = 96 + 144i \).

So, \( E = A z + \frac{B}{z} \). Let me denote \( z = 4 e^{i\theta} \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). Then, \( E = A * 4 e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Compute \( A * 4 \): \( (75 + 117i) * 4 = 300 + 468i \).

Compute \( B / 4 \): \( (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i \).

Therefore, \( E = (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \). Which is the same as before.

So, I think my first approach is correct.

Thus, computing the real part as \( 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta \), and then the maximum is \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \).

So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, hold on, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Let me verify the coefficients again.

From the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \).

Computed real part as \( 300 \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta \). Let me check:

Multiplying \( 300 \) with \( \cos \theta \): real.

Multiplying \( 468i \) with \( \cos \theta \): imaginary.

Multiplying \( 300 \) with \( i \sin \theta \): imaginary.

Multiplying \( 468i \) with \( i \sin \theta \): real, but with \( i^2 = -1 \), so it becomes negative real.

Therefore, real parts: 300 cos theta - 468 sin theta.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos theta - i sin theta) \).

Real part: 24 cos theta - 36 i cos theta - 24 i sin theta + 36 sin theta.

Wait, no, wait: using the formula \( (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \).

So, with \( a = 24 \), \( b = 36 \), \( c = cos theta \), \( d = - sin theta \).

So, real part: \( 24 cos theta - 36 (- sin theta) = 24 cos theta + 36 sin theta \).

Imaginary part: \( 24 (- sin theta) + 36 cos theta = -24 sin theta + 36 cos theta \).

Yes, correct.

So, adding the real parts: \( 300 cos theta - 468 sin theta + 24 cos theta + 36 sin theta \).

= \( (300 + 24) cos theta + (-468 + 36) sin theta \).

= \( 324 cos theta - 432 sin theta \).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the maximum of this is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Compute 324 squared: 324*324.

Let me compute 300^2=90,000.

24^2=576.

Cross term: 2*300*24=14,400.

So, (300 + 24)^2=90,000 + 14,400 + 576= 90,000 + 14,400=104,400 +576=105, 976.

Similarly, 432^2.

Compute 400^2=160,000.

32^2=1,024.

Cross term: 2*400*32=25,600.

So, (400 + 32)^2=160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

Therefore, sqrt(105,976 +186,624)=sqrt(292,6000? Wait, 105,976 +186,624=292,6000?

Wait, no, 105,976 +186,624.

105,976 + 186,624.

100,000 + 100,000=200,000.

5,976 +86,624.

5,976 +86,624=92,600.

So total is 200,000 +92,600=292,600.

Wait, 105,976 +186,624=292,600.

So sqrt(292,600).

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 540. Wait, sqrt(292,600)=?

Wait, 540 squared is 291,600, right?

Because 500^2=250,000.

540^2=(500 +40)^2=500^2 +2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600.

But 291,600 is less than 292,600.

So, sqrt(292,600)= approximately 540.8, but not exactly 540.

Wait, so did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, 324^2 + (-432)^2=324^2 +432^2=105,976 +186,624=292,600.

So sqrt(292,600)= approximately 540.8.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought 324^2 +432^2=291,600, which was wrong.

Wait, that was a mistake.

Wait, 324 squared is 105,976.

432 squared is 186,624.

So adding those, 105,976 +186,624=292,600.

Therefore, sqrt(292,600). Let me compute sqrt(292,600).

First, note that 540^2=291,600.

So sqrt(292,600)=sqrt(291,600 +1,000)=sqrt(540^2 +1,000).

So approximately, sqrt(291,600 +1,000)≈540 +1,000/(2*540)=540 +1,000/1080≈540 +0.9259≈540.9259.

So approximately 540.9259.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, so if R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.9259.

So, the maximum real part is approximately540.9259.

But is that exact?

Wait, let me see if 292,600 is a perfect square.

Let me try 542^2.

542^2= (540 +2)^2=540^2 +4*540 +4=291,600 +2,160 +4=293,764.

Which is more than 292,600.

Similarly, 541^2= (540 +1)^2=540^2 +2*540 +1=291,600 +1,080 +1=292,681.

Which is still more than 292,600.

540^2=291,600.

So, 540^2=291,600.

540.5^2=?

Compute 540.5^2= (540 +0.5)^2=540^2 +2*540*0.5 +0.25=291,600 +540 +0.25=292,140.25.

Still less than 292,600.

540.75^2= (540 +0.75)^2=540^2 +2*540*0.75 +0.75^2=291,600 +810 +0.5625=292,410.5625.

Still less than 292,600.

540.9^2=?

Compute 540 +0.9 squared: 540^2 +2*540*0.9 +0.81=291,600 +972 +0.81=292,572.81.

Still less than 292,600.

540.9259^2=?

Wait, perhaps sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.9259, as I had before.

But, since 292,600=100*2,926.

Wait, 2,926 is divisible by 2: 2,926=2*1,463.

1,463 is a prime? Let me check.

1,463 divided by 13: 13*112=1,456. 1,463-1,456=7. Not divisible.

1,463 divided by 7: 7*209=1,463? 7*200=1,400, 7*9=63; 1,400+63=1,463. Yes, 1,463=7*209.

209: 11*19=209.

So, 2,926=2*7*11*19.

So sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2*7*11*19)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(11)*sqrt(19).

Which is irrational. So, sqrt(292,600)=sqrt(100*2,926)=10*sqrt(2,926)=10*sqrt(2*7*11*19)=10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

So, it's irrational, not an integer.

Therefore, the maximum real part is sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.9259.

But wait, wait, the problem asks for the largest possible real part.

But in the problem statement, it says "the largest possible real part", which is a specific number.

But is it 540.9259, or is there a more precise expression?

Wait, but in the initial step, I thought that the maximum is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.9259.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, in the real part, is it 324 cos theta - 432 sin theta?

Wait, hold on, let me re-examine the real part calculation.

From the first term: (300 +468i)(cos theta + i sin theta).

Real part is 300 cos theta -468 sin theta.

From the second term: (24 +36i)(cos theta - i sin theta).

Real part is 24 cos theta +36 sin theta.

Therefore, adding these: 300 cos theta -468 sin theta +24 cos theta +36 sin theta.

Which is (300 +24) cos theta + (-468 +36) sin theta=324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

Yes, correct.

So, the real part is 324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

So, to find the maximum of this expression, which is equal to sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.9259.

But since 292,600=100*2,926, sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(2,926)=10*sqrt(2*7*11*19)=10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19). Which is about 10*1.4142*sqrt(1,463). Wait, 1,463=7*11*19.

Wait, sqrt(1,463)= approx 38.25.

So, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2*1,463)=sqrt(2)*38.25≈1.4142*38.25≈54.09.

Therefore, sqrt(292,600)=10*54.09≈540.9.

So, approximately540.9.

But the problem says "the largest possible real part", so likely it's 540.9 or something, but since the problem is in integers, maybe 541? But 540.9 is closer to 541.

Wait, but 540.9259 is about 540.93, which is still less than 541.

Alternatively, maybe 540.9259 is the exact value.

But let me think again: perhaps I made a miscalculation in the real part.

Wait, let me recompute the real parts:

First term: (300 +468i)(cos theta + i sin theta).

Real part: 300 cos theta -468 sin theta.

Second term: (24 +36i)(cos theta -i sin theta).

Real part: 24 cos theta +36 sin theta.

Therefore, total real part: 300 cos theta -468 sin theta +24 cos theta +36 sin theta.

= (300 +24) cos theta + (-468 +36) sin theta.

=324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

Yes, that's correct.

So, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

Thus, the expression is of the form a cos theta +b sin theta, with a=324, b=-432.

The maximum is sqrt(a^2 +b^2)=sqrt(324^2 +432^2).

Which is sqrt(105,976 +186,624)=sqrt(292,600).

Which is sqrt(100*2,926)=10*sqrt(2,926)=10*sqrt(2*7*11*19).

So, it's irrational.

But the question says "the largest possible real part".

So, perhaps I can write it as 10*sqrt(2,926). But 2,926 is 2*7*11*19.

Alternatively, maybe factor further.

Wait, 2*7*11*19=2*7*11*19= 2*7=14; 14*11=154; 154*19=2,926.

So, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2*7*11*19).

Which can be written as sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

So, sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19). But 7*11=77, 77*19=1,463. So, sqrt(2)*sqrt(1,463).

So, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(1,463).

Thus, sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(2,926)=10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1,463).

So, approximately 10*1.4142*38.25≈10*54.09≈540.9.

So, approximately540.9.

But the problem is expecting an exact value, I think.

Wait, 540.9259 is approximately540.9259, which is 540 and 17/19, since 17/19≈0.8947, which is close to 0.9259.

But 17/19≈0.8947, 18/19≈0.9474.

Wait, 0.9259 is closer to 18/19.

Wait, 18/19≈0.9474, which is higher than 0.9259.

Alternatively, maybe it's 540 + 17/19, which is approximately540.8947.

Wait, but my approximate sqrt(292,600)=540.9259, which is about540 + 0.9259, which is 540 + 17/19≈540.8947? Wait, no, 17/19≈0.8947, so 540 +17/19≈540.8947.

Wait, but my approximation was 540.9259, which is about 540 + 17/19.47.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute sqrt(292,600).

Wait, 540^2=291,600.

So, 540.9^2=?

Compute 540 +0.9 squared:

=540^2 +2*540*0.9 +0.9^2=291,600 +972 +0.81=292,572.81.

Which is less than 292,600.

So, 540.9^2=292,572.81.

Difference:292,600 -292,572.81=27.19.

So, to find x such that (540.9 +x)^2=292,600.

Approximate x:

(540.9 +x)^2≈540.9^2 +2*540.9 x +x^2=292,572.81 +1081.8 x +x^2=292,600.

So, 1081.8 x≈292,600 -292,572.81=27.19.

Thus, x≈27.19 /1081.8≈0.0251.

Thus, sqrt(292,600)≈540.9 +0.0251≈540.9251.

So, approximately540.9251.

So, approximately540.925.

So, approximately540.925.

Therefore, the maximum real part is approximately540.925.

But the problem is asking for the largest possible real part, so it's likely that this is the exact value, which is sqrt(292,600)=sqrt(100*2,926)=10*sqrt(2,926).

But, perhaps, simplifying sqrt(2,926).

Wait, 2,926 divided by 2 is 1,463.

1,463 is a prime? Let me check.

Wait, 1,463 divided by 7: 7*209=1,463.

209 is 11*19.

So, 1,463=7*11*19.

So, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2*7*11*19)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

So, sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

But this is as simplified as it gets.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact form, so 10*sqrt(2926).

But 2,926=2*7*11*19, so sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

Thus, the exact value is 10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7*11*19).

But perhaps it's better to write it as 10*sqrt(2*7*11*19).

Alternatively, factor it as 10*sqrt(2*7*11*19).

But, perhaps, the problem expects the answer as 540, but that's only approximate.

Wait, but my calculation shows that it's approximately540.925, which is more than540.

Wait, but the maximum of the expression is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.925.

So, perhaps the problem expects the exact value, which is sqrt(292,600). But sqrt(292,600) can be simplified.

Wait, sqrt(292,600)=sqrt(100*2,926)=10*sqrt(2,926).

But 2,926=2*7*11*19, so sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(11)*sqrt(19).

Therefore, the exact value is 10*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(11)*sqrt(19).

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 540, but that is only approximate.

Wait, but 540 is less than the actual maximum, which is approximately540.925.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the coefficients.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that for a complex number z with |z|=4, then z can be written as 4 e^{i theta}, so 1/z= (1/4)e^{-i theta}.

Therefore, E=(75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z= (75 +117i)*4 e^{i theta} + (96 +144i)/4 e^{-i theta}.

Compute the constants:

(75 +117i)*4= 300 +468i.

(96 +144i)/4=24 +36i.

So, E=(300 +468i) e^{i theta} + (24 +36i) e^{-i theta}.

So, E is a complex number, and we need the real part of E.

Expressed in terms of cos theta and sin theta, as before.

So, Re(E)=300 cos theta -468 sin theta +24 cos theta +36 sin theta=324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

So, as before.

Therefore, Re(E)=324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

Now, to find the maximum of Re(E), which is equal to sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approximately540.925.

But the problem is asking for the largest possible real part, so is this the answer?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact form, but given that 292,600=100*2,926, and 2,926=2*7*11*19, so sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(2*7*11*19).

Therefore, it's 10*sqrt(2,926)=10*sqrt(2*7*11*19).

But this is an exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting an approximate decimal value, but since the problem is given with integer coefficients, it's more likely that the answer is an exact value.

But in the initial calculation, I thought sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=540.9259.

Wait, but is there a smarter way to compute sqrt(292,600)?

Wait, 292,600=100*2,926.

So, sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(2,926).

Wait, 2,926 divided by 14 is 209.

So, 2,926=14*209.

209=11*19.

Thus, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(14*11*19)=sqrt(14)*sqrt(11*19).

So, sqrt(2,926)=sqrt(14)*sqrt(209).

Therefore, sqrt(292,600)=10*sqrt(14)*sqrt(209).

But sqrt(14)*sqrt(209)=sqrt(14*209)=sqrt(2,926).

So, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps 10*sqrt(14*209).

But 14*209=2,926.

So, same thing.

Alternatively, perhaps leave it as sqrt(292,600).

But I don't think that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps notice that 324 and 432 are multiples of 108.

324=3*108.

432=4*108.

Therefore, 324=3*108, 432=4*108.

So, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

Thus, the expression is 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

So, the maximum of this is 108*sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2)=108*sqrt(9 +16)=108*sqrt(25)=108*5=540.

Wait, that's different. Wait, so is it 540?

Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, wait, hold on.

Wait, 324=3*108, 432=4*108.

So, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

Thus, the expression is 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

So, the maximum of 3 cos theta -4 sin theta is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2)=5.

Therefore, the maximum of 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is 108*5=540.

Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me think.

If I have an expression like a cos theta +b sin theta, its maximum is sqrt(a^2 +b^2). So, if I have 3 cos theta -4 sin theta, the maximum is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2)=5.

Therefore, 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta) has maximum 108*5=540.

But in my earlier calculation, I had sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Wait, but 108*5=540, which is less than 540.925.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me verify:

324 cos theta -432 sin theta.

Expressed as 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

So, the maximum of 3 cos theta -4 sin theta is 5, so the maximum of the expression is 540.

But in my earlier approach, I thought that sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

But wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, because in reality, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is equal to 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

But 3 cos theta -4 sin theta can be written as 5 cos(theta + phi), where phi is some angle.

So, the maximum of 3 cos theta -4 sin theta is 5, so the maximum of the entire expression is 108*5=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, so why did my earlier calculation give me sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925?

Because I considered the expression 324 cos theta -432 sin theta as a single sinusoidal function, which indeed has maximum sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

But wait, if 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta), then 3 cos theta -4 sin theta has maximum 5, so 108*5=540.

But that would mean that 324 cos theta -432 sin theta has maximum 540, not sqrt(292,600).

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is equal to 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

But 3 cos theta -4 sin theta can be expressed as R cos(theta + phi), where R=5, as above.

Therefore, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta)=108*R cos(theta + phi)=108*5 cos(theta + phi).

Thus, the maximum of this is 108*5=540.

But wait, that conflicts with the other approach where I thought the maximum is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach.

Wait, in the second approach, I thought of 324 cos theta -432 sin theta as a single sinusoidal function.

But if 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta), which is equal to 108*5 cos(theta + phi), then the maximum is 540.

But 108*5=540, which is less than sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, so is 324 cos theta -432 sin theta equal to 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta), which can be written as 540 cos(theta + phi).

But then, 540 cos(theta + phi) has a maximum of 540, so the maximum is 540.

But then, why does the formula for a cos theta +b sin theta give sqrt(a^2 +b^2) as the maximum?

Because, in that formula, a and b are coefficients, not scaled by another factor.

Wait, in this case, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

So, it's a scaled version of 3 cos theta -4 sin theta.

So, in effect, 3 cos theta -4 sin theta is a sinusoidal function with amplitude 5, so 108*(that) has amplitude 540.

But if you don't factor out the 108, then 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is a sinusoidal function with amplitude sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, actually, I think both are correct depending on how you represent it.

If you write 324 cos theta -432 sin theta as 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta), then its amplitude is 108*5=540.

But if you don't factor out the 108, then the amplitude is sqrt(324^2 +432^2)=sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Wait, but 108*(5)=540, which is less than sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925.

Therefore, there is a discrepancy here.

Wait, so perhaps the mistake is that in the expression 324 cos theta -432 sin theta, it's not a pure sinusoid with amplitude sqrt(324^2 +432^2), because 324 and 432 are scaled by 108, so it's actually a scaled version.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify.

Compute 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

Express 3 cos theta -4 sin theta as R cos(theta + phi).

So, R=5, so 3 cos theta -4 sin theta=5 cos(theta + phi).

Thus, 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta)=108*5 cos(theta + phi)=540 cos(theta + phi).

Therefore, the expression is 540 cos(theta + phi).

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

But then, why does the other approach give me approximately540.925?

Wait, because when I compute sqrt(324^2 +432^2), I get sqrt(292,600)=approx540.925, which is higher than 540.

But in reality, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is equal to 540 cos(theta + phi), which has maximum 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

So, why is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) higher?

Because, in the formula, if I have a cos theta +b sin theta, the maximum is sqrt(a^2 +b^2). But in this case, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is not simply a cos theta +b sin theta, but it's a combination where a=324, b=-432.

But in this case, 324 and 432 are multiples of 108, so 324=3*108, 432=4*108.

So, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta=108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta).

And since 3 cos theta -4 sin theta can be expressed as 5 cos(theta + phi), the maximum is 5, so the entire expression is 108*5=540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

But then why does the formula for a cos theta +b sin theta give sqrt(a^2 +b^2)?

Because in that formula, the coefficients are not scaled by another factor.

In this case, 324 cos theta -432 sin theta is equivalent to 108*(3 cos theta -4 sin theta), which is a scaled version.

Therefore, in this case, the maximum is 540.

So, my initial approach was wrong because I didn't factor out the 108, which was a common factor.

Therefore, the correct maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

So, I think that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}
</think>

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4 e^{i\theta}\). This gives us \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta}
\]
Calculating the constants separately:
- First term: \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4 = 300 + 468i\)
- Second term: \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i\)

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
E = (300 + 468i) e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta}
\]

Using Euler's formula, we express each term in terms of \(\cos \theta\) and \(\sin \theta\):
- First term: \((300 + 468i)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\)
- Second term: \((24 + 36i)(\cos \theta - i \sin \theta)\)

Calculating the real parts:
- First term's real part: \(300 \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta\)
- Second term's real part: \(24 \cos \theta + 36 \sin \theta\)

Summing these, the total real part of \(E\) is:
\[
300 \cos \theta - 468 \sin \theta + 24 \cos \theta + 36 \sin \theta = 324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta
\]

To find the maximum value of this expression, we recognize it as a linear combination of \(\cos \theta\) and \(\sin \theta\). The maximum value of such an expression is given by the amplitude, which is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}
\]

Calculating this:
- \(324^2 = 104976\)
- \(432^2 = 186624\)
- Sum: \(104976 + 186624 = 292600\)
- Square root: \(\sqrt{292600} = 540.9259\)

However, recognizing that \(324 \cos \theta - 432 \sin \theta\) can be factored as \(108(3 \cos \theta - 4 \sin \theta)\), we find the maximum value is:
\[
108 \times 5 = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]
