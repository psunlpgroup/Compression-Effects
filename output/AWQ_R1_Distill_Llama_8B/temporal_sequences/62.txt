Alright, let's try to figure out when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio. So, first, let's list out all the information we have.

Andrew wakes up at 8am. That's the starting point.

Then, Thomas saw Andrew playing tennis at the tennis court from 8am to 11am. So, Andrew was at the tennis court during that time.

Mary saw Andrew reading at the library from 11am to 1pm. So, after playing tennis, Andrew went to the library and was there until 1pm.

Michael saw Andrew fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8pm to 10pm. That's in the evening, after presumably Andrew has finished whatever he was doing earlier.

The dance studio was closed after 10pm. So, the dance studio only operates until 10pm, and after that, it's closed.

Now, we need to find the time window when Andrew could have gone to the dance studio. So, let's piece this together.

Andrew wakes up at 8am. From 8am to 11am, he's playing tennis. So, he's occupied during that time.

From 11am to 1pm, he's reading at the library. So, that's another block of time he's busy.

Then, in the evening, from 8pm to 10pm, he's fixing the computer. So, that's another time he's occupied.

Now, the dance studio is only open until 10pm. So, the latest he could have possibly gone to the dance studio is before 10pm.

Looking at his schedule:

- 8am to 11am: Tennis
- 11am to 1pm: Library
- 8pm to 10pm: Computer

So, the times when Andrew is free are:

- Between 1pm and 8pm.

Because from 1pm to 8pm, he's not doing anything mentioned. He's not at the tennis court, not at the library, and not fixing the computer.

So, the dance studio could have been during that free time.

But wait, let's double-check the options:

(A) 8pm to 10pm: He's fixing the computer, so he can't be at the dance studio then.

(B) 11am to 1pm: He's reading at the library.

(C) 8am to 11am: He's playing tennis.

(D) 1pm to 8pm: That's when he's free.

So, the correct time is 1pm to 8pm, which is option (D).

But wait, the dance studio was closed after 10pm. So, does that mean he could have gone after 10pm? But Michael saw him until 10pm, fixing the computer. So, he's occupied until 10pm. So, the dance studio is closed after 10pm, so he can't go after that.

Therefore, the latest he could have gone is before 10pm. But since he's busy until 10pm, the only free time is before 1pm. Wait, no:

Wait, from 1pm to 8pm, he's free. So, he could have gone to the dance studio any time during that period.

So, the answer is (D) 1pm to 8pm.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are:

(A) 8pm to 10pm

(B) 11am to 1pm

(C) 8am to 11am

(D) 1pm to 8pm

Yes, so (D) is the correct answer.

But wait, the dance studio was closed after 10pm. So, if he went after 10pm, the studio was closed. So, he couldn't have gone after 10pm. Therefore, the latest he could have gone is before 10pm.

But in the options, (D) is 1pm to 8pm, which is before 10pm, so that's okay.

Wait, but 1pm to 8pm includes times when he could have gone to the dance studio. So, that's the correct window.

So, the correct answer is (D).

But wait, let me make sure again. Let's lay out the timeline:

- 8am: Andrew wakes up.

- 8am-11am: Playing tennis.

- 11am-1pm: Reading at the library.

- 1pm-8pm: Free.

- 8pm-10pm: Fixing the computer.

So, he's free from 1pm to 8pm, which is when he could have gone to the dance studio.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1pm to 8pm.

But wait, the options are:

(A) 8pm to 10pm

(B) 11am to 1pm

(C) 8am to 11am

(D) 1pm to 8pm

Yes, so (D) is correct.

The correct answer is (D) 1pm to 8pm.

Answer: (D)
