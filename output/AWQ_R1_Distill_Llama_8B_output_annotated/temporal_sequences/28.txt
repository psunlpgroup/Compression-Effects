["initializing"] Alright, let's figure out when William could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll start by listing out the information provided. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, William woke up at 9am. That's his wake-up time. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, Linda saw William playing tennis at the tennis court from 9am to 11am. So, William was at the tennis court during that time. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, Emily saw William attending class at the school from 11am to 1pm. So, William was in class during that period. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] After that, Nancy saw William walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm. So, he was in the garden in the evening. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The coffee shop was closed after 7pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] That means William couldn't have gone there after 7pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, let's see when William was free. He was at the tennis court from 9am to 11am, in class from 11am to 1pm, and walking in the garden from 6pm to 7pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Between 1pm and 6pm, William was not at the tennis court, not in class, and not walking in the garden. So, during that time, he could have gone to the coffee shop. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the possible time William could have gone to the coffee shop is between 1pm and 6pm. ["end-section"]
