Alright, let's try to figure out when Andrew could have gone to the park. So, we know Andrew's schedule from various people's perspectives, and we need to piece together the possible times he was free to go to the park. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, Andrew wakes up at 6am. That means he was likely at home or just starting his day around that time. Then, David saw him stretching at a yoga studio from 6am to 7am. So, from 6am to 7am, he's at the yoga studio. That means he left his house around 6am to go to the yoga studio.

Next, Leslie saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli from 7am to 9am. So, after yoga, he went to the deli to buy lunch. That means he arrived at the deli sometime after 7am and left around 9am.

Then, James saw Andrew waiting at the train station from 9am to 12pm. So, after buying lunch, he went to the train station. He arrived there around 9am and left after noon.

Tiffany saw Andrew working at the office from 12pm to 3pm. So, after the train station, he went to work. He arrived at the office around noon and left in the afternoon, probably around 3pm.

Mark saw Andrew waiting at the airport from 3pm to 7pm. So, after work, he went to the airport. He arrived there around 3pm and waited until 7pm.

Now, the park was closed after 10pm. So, if he went to the park, he would have to be there before 10pm.

Let's try to fit this in. From 6am to 7am, he's at yoga. From 7am to 9am, he's buying lunch. From 9am to 12pm, he's at the train station. From 12pm to 3pm, he's working. From 3pm to 7pm, he's at the airport.

Looking at his schedule, after the airport, he's busy until 7pm. The park is closed after 10pm, so if he went to the park, he would have to go before 10pm. But according to Mark, he was at the airport until 7pm. So, he didn't have time to go to the park after that.

Wait, but maybe he went earlier. Let's see. From 6am to 7am, he's at yoga. 7am to 9am, deli. 9am to 12pm, train station. 12pm to 3pm, office. 3pm to 7pm, airport. So, the only time he wasn't accounted for is between 7pm and 10pm when the park is still open.

But according to Mark, he was waiting at the airport from 3pm to 7pm. So, he left the airport at 7pm. The park closes at 10pm, so from 7pm to 10pm, the park is still open. Therefore, Andrew could have gone to the park between 7pm and 10pm.

So, the possible time he could have gone is from 7pm to 10pm.

Let's check the options:

(A) 6am to 7am - He was at yoga then.

(B) 9am to 12pm - He was at the train station then.

(C) 7pm to 10pm - This fits.

(D) 7am to 9am - He was buying lunch then.

So, the correct answer is (C).

The correct answer is (C) 7pm to 10pm.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Andrew's schedule from others' observations:
   - 6am-7am: Yoga
   - 7am-9am: Deli
   - 9am-12pm: Train station
   - 12pm-3pm: Office
   - 3pm-7pm: Airport

2. The park is open until 10pm.

3. The only free time after the airport is from 7pm to 10pm.

Therefore, Andrew could have gone to the park between **7pm to 10pm**.

Answer: (C)
