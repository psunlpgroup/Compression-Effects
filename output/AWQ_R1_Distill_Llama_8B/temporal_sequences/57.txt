Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Michael could have gone to the football field. I'll start by listing out all the information we have.

First, Michael woke up at 10am. So, Michael's day starts at 10am.

Next, John saw Michael taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 12pm to 2pm. That means Michael was in Paris during that time.

Then, Samantha saw Michael watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 4pm. So, Michael was at the theater between 2pm and 4pm.

After that, Thomas saw Michael sitting on a rooftop from 4pm to 8pm. So, Michael was on the rooftop during that time.

Now, the football field was closed after 8pm. That means the football field was open before 8pm, but closed after 8pm.

So, Michael could have gone to the football field before 8pm, but after his activities in Paris, the theater, and the rooftop.

Let's break it down step by step.

1. Michael wakes up at 10am.
2. From 12pm to 2pm: Michael is taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
3. From 2pm to 4pm: Michael is watching a movie at the theater.
4. From 4pm to 8pm: Michael is sitting on a rooftop.

So, Michael is occupied from 12pm until 8pm. The football field is closed after 8pm, so Michael would have to go to the football field before 8pm, but after his activities.

Since Michael is occupied until 8pm, he couldn't have gone to the football field during his activities. Therefore, Michael couldn't have gone to the football field during his time in Paris, at the theater, or on the rooftop.

Since the football field was closed after 8pm, and Michael was occupied until 8pm, there might be a window before he started his activities where he could have gone to the football field.

Michael wakes up at 10am. So, from 10am to 12pm, Michael is free.

John saw Michael taking photos from 12pm to 2pm, so Michael was occupied during that time.

Therefore, the only free time Michael had before he was occupied by activities is from 10am to 12pm.

So, Michael could have gone to the football field between 10am and 12pm.

Now, looking at the options:

(A) 12pm to 2pm – Michael was occupied during that time.

(B) 10am to 12pm – This is the free time before he started his activities.

(C) 2pm to 4pm – Michael was at the theater during that time.

(D) 4pm to 8pm – Michael was on the rooftop during that time.

So, the correct answer is option (B) 10am to 12pm.

But wait, the options are given as (A) 12pm to 2pm, (B) 10am to 12pm, (C) 2pm to 4pm, (D) 4pm to 8pm.

So, the answer is (B).

But let me double-check.

Michael is free from 10am to 12pm.

Then, he is occupied from 12pm to 2pm, 2pm to 4pm, and 4pm to 8pm.

The football field was closed after 8pm, but Michael was occupied until 8pm, so he couldn't have gone to the football field after 8pm.

Therefore, the only possible time is between 10am to 12pm.

So, yes, option (B) is correct.

The football field was closed after 8pm, but Michael was occupied from 10am to 8pm. The only free time Michael had was from 10am to 12pm, which is when he could have gone to the football field.

Answer: (B) 10am to 12pm.
