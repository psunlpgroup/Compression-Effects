Alright, let's break this down step by step. I need to figure out during which time Kimberly could have gone to the construction site. Let's start by listing out all the information given.

First, Kimberly wakes up at 6am. That's her starting point. Then, several people saw her doing different activities at specific times:

1. **Hannah** saw Kimberly buying cookies at a bakery from 7am to 8am.
2. **Thomas** saw Kimberly fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8am to 10am.
3. **John** saw Kimberly buying a phone at the electronics store from 10am to 11am.
4. **David** saw Kimberly playing tennis at the tennis court from 11am to 2pm.
5. **Mark** saw Kimberly watching a movie at the theater from 2pm to 3pm.

Importantly, the construction site was closed after 3pm. So, Kimberly would have needed to visit the construction site before 3pm.

Let's map out the timeline:

- **6am**: Kimberly wakes up.
- **7am - 8am**: Buying cookies.
- **8am - 10am**: Fixing the computer.
- **10am - 11am**: Buying a phone.
- **11am - 2pm**: Playing tennis.
- **2pm - 3pm**: Watching a movie.
- **After 3pm**: Construction site is closed.

From this, we can see that Kimberly was very busy from 6am to 3pm. She didn't have any free time to go to the construction site until after 3pm, but the site was closed by then.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. She must have gone earlier. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Actually, the construction site was closed after 3pm, so she must have gone before 3pm. But according to the timeline, she was occupied from 6am to 3pm. So, she didn't have time to go to the construction site during her activities.

Hmm, that would mean she couldn't have gone to the construction site because she was busy doing other things from 6am until after 3pm, when the site closed. So, there's no time left for her to visit the construction site.

But wait, the question is asking "Between what times could they have gone?" implying that it's possible, but based on her schedule, she didn't have any free time.

So, the only possible time is before 6am, but she just woke up at 6am. So, she couldn't have gone before that.

Therefore, the correct answer is that she couldn't have gone to the construction site at all. But since the options are specific times, and none of them align with her schedule, the only logical answer is that she didn't have time, so the construction site visit couldn't have happened.

But looking at the options, none of them are before 6am, so technically, the only time she was free was before 6am, but she just woke up at 6am. So, she didn't have time to go.

Wait, maybe the construction site was closed after 3pm, so she might have gone before her activities started. But her first activity was at 7am, so she could have gone between 6am and 7am.

That makes sense. She woke up at 6am and could have gone to the construction site any time between 6am and when Hannah saw her buying cookies at 7am.

So, the possible time is from 6am to 7am.

Looking back at the options:

(A) 6am to 7am

(B) 8am to 10am

(C) 10am to 11am

(D) 11am to 2pm

Yes, option A is the correct time she could have gone to the construction site.
</think>

The correct answer is (A) 6am to 7am.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Kimberly's Schedule:**
   - Wakes up at 6am.
   - Subsequent sightings:
     - Hannah: 7am - 8am (buying cookies).
     - Thomas: 8am - 10am (fixing computer).
     - John: 10am - 11am (buying phone).
     - David: 11am - 2pm (playing tennis).
     - Mark: 2pm - 3pm (watching movie).

2. **Construction Site Closure:**
   - Closed after 3pm.

3. **Determining Possible Time to Visit Construction Site:**
   - Kimberly was occupied from 6am to 3pm.
   - The only free time before her activities started is between 6am and 7am.

**Answer:** (A) 6am to 7am
