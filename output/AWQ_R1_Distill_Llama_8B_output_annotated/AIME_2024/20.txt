["initializing"]Alright, so I've got this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]First, the problem defines a positive integer \( n \) as \( b \)-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied: 
1. When \( n \) is written in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits. 
2. The sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).["end-section"]

["example-testing"]For example, it says that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 and 3, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.["end-section"]

["initializing"]The task is to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out the least base \( b \) where the count of such numbers exceeds ten.["end-section"]

["initializing"]Let me break down the problem step by step.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]**Understanding the Structure of \( n \) in Base \( b \):**

In any base \( b \), a two-digit number can be represented as \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \), where \( d_1 \) is the digit in the \( b \) place and \( d_0 \) is the digit in the units place. Here, \( d_1 \) can range from 1 to \( b - 1 \) because it can't be zero (otherwise, it would be a single-digit number), and \( d_0 \) can range from 0 to \( b - 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, the two-digit number in base \( b \) is \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \).["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]**Condition for \( b \)-eautiful Number:**

The number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if the sum of its digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \). So, mathematically, this can be written as:
\[ d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \]
But since \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \), substituting that into the equation gives:
\[ d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{d_1 \times b + d_0} \] 
["end-section"]

["deduction"]Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[ (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 \times b + d_0 \] 

Expanding the left side:
\[ d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \]

Let's rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:
\[ d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1 b - d_0 = 0 \] 

This looks like a quadratic in terms of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \).["end-section"]

["initializing"]Maybe I can treat this equation as a quadratic equation in \( d_1 \) for each \( d_0 \), or vice versa.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Alternatively, let's consider it as a quadratic equation in \( d_1 \):
\[ d_1^2 + (2d_0 - b)d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \] 

Similarly, it's a quadratic in \( d_0 \):
\[ d_0^2 + (2d_1 - 1)d_0 + (d_1^2 - d_1 b) = 0 \] 

["uncertainty-estimation"]Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Maybe it's better to fix \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) within their ranges and see when the equation holds.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]**Expressing \( n \) as a Two-Digit Number in Base \( b \):**

Let me denote \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), which is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \). So, \( s = \sqrt{n} \) implies \( n = s^2 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]But also, \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \). So, we have:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \]

But \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so substituting:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \] 

Simplify this:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \]

\[ s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \] 
So:
\[ d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \] 
["end-section"]

["deduction"]Interesting. So, \( d_1 \) must be an integer because it's a digit in base \( b \). Therefore, \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Also, \( d_1 \) must satisfy \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \), and \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must satisfy \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b - 1 \).["end-section"]

["initializing"]So, let's write down the constraints:

1. \( s \) must be an integer because \( s = \sqrt{n} \) and \( n \) is a positive integer.
2. \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer.
3. \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \), inclusive.["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, our goal is, for each base \( b \), to count the number of integers \( s \) such that \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) defined as above satisfy the digit constraints.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Alternatively, since \( s \) is the square root of \( n \), \( s \) must be an integer, so \( n \) must be a perfect square.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Therefore, for each base \( b \), the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of perfect squares \( s^2 \) such that:
- \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
- \( d_1 + d_0 = s \)
- \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \)
- \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b - 1 \)["end-section"]

["initializing"]So, perhaps another way to think about this is that \( s^2 \) can be written as a two-digit number in base \( b \), with digits \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), such that their sum is \( s \).["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Alternatively, \( s^2 \) must be a two-digit number in base \( b \), so it must satisfy:
\[ b \leq s^2 \leq b^2 - 1 \]
Because the smallest two-digit number in base \( b \) is \( 10_b = b \), and the largest is \( (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, \( s^2 \) must lie in the interval \( [b, b^2 - 1] \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]Also, since \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), and \( d_1 \geq 1 \), \( d_0 \geq 0 \), so \( s \geq 1 + 0 = 1 \). But since \( s^2 \geq b \), and \( b \geq 2 \), \( s \geq \sqrt{b} \). So, \( s \) is at least 2 when \( b \geq 4 \), but for \( b = 2 \), \( s \geq \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), so \( s \geq 2 \).["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, actually, \( s \) must be integer because \( s = \sqrt{n} \), so \( s \) must be an integer greater than or equal to 2 (since \( n \geq 1 \), but for \( n \geq b \), which is at least 2, \( s \geq 2 \)).["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, for each base \( b \), we can consider \( s \) starting from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) up to \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \), which is just less than \( b \). So, \( s \) ranges from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]But perhaps more precise: \( s \) is such that \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( s^2 \geq b \) and \( s^2 < b^2 \). Therefore, \( s \) must satisfy \( \sqrt{b} \leq s < b \). Since \( s \) is an integer, \( s \) can be from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).["end-section"]

["initializing"]So, for each \( b \), the possible values of \( s \) are integers from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \). For each such \( s \), we can compute \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), and check whether \( d_1 \) is an integer and whether \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).["end-section"]

["deduction"]So, to count the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we need to count the number of integers \( s \) in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \) such that \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are valid digits in base \( b \).["end-section"]

["initializing"]Therefore, for each \( b \), we can iterate through each \( s \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \), compute \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), check if they are valid, and count how many such \( s \) satisfy the conditions.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Our goal is to find the smallest \( b \) such that this count exceeds 10.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]So, perhaps we can approach this problem by incrementally testing bases starting from \( b = 2 \) upwards, computing the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers for each \( b \), and stopping when we find the first \( b \) where the count is greater than 10.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But before diving into code or extensive calculations, maybe there's a pattern or a formula we can derive.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]**Expressing \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) in Terms of \( s \) and \( b \):**

From earlier, we have:
\[ d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \]
\[ d_0 = s - d_1 = s - \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} = \frac{(s)(b - 1) - (s^2 - s)}{b - 1} = \frac{s b - s - s^2 + s}{b - 1} = \frac{s b - s^2}{b - 1} \]

So, both \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) must be integers. Therefore, \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) must be integers, which imposes conditions on \( s \) and \( b \).

["deduction"]So, \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer, and \( \frac{s b - s^2}{b - 1} \) must also be an integer.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, perhaps if I write \( d_1 = \frac{s(s - 1)}{b - 1} \), so \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]But since \( b - 1 \) and \( s \) may not necessarily be coprime, this might not hold. Alternatively, because \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must be a divisor of either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but not necessarily both.["end-section"]

["backtracking"]Wait, perhaps that's too restrictive. Maybe a better approach is to note that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \), so \( b - 1 \) must divide the product \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but not necessarily both.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]Wait, perhaps I can think of \( b - 1 \) as a factor of \( s(s - 1) \). So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).["end-section"]
