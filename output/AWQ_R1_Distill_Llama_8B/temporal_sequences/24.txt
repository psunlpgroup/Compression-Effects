Alright, let's try to figure out when Andrew could have gone to the art studio. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.

First, Andrew wakes up at 8am. That's his starting point. Then, Richard saw Andrew buying a phone at the electronics store from 8am to 10am. So, Richard saw Andrew between 8am and 10am.

Next, Samantha saw Andrew fixing their computer at the same electronics store from 10am to 2pm. So, Samantha's time overlaps with Richard's time a bit, from 10am to 10am when the phone purchase happened, and then from 10am to 2pm for the computer fix.

Then, Michael saw Andrew reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm. So, Michael's observation is later in the day.

Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. So, Sarah's time overlaps with Michael's time, from 4pm to 4pm when Michael saw him reading, and then from 4pm to 6pm for lunch.

The art studio was closed after 6pm. That means Andrew couldn't have gone to the art studio after 6pm.

Now, let's piece this together. Andrew was at the electronics store from 8am to 2pm, as seen by Richard and Samantha. Then, after that, Michael saw him at the library from 3pm to 4pm, and Sarah saw him buying lunch from 4pm to 6pm.

Since the art studio was closed after 6pm, Andrew couldn't have gone there after 6pm. But he was at the library and deli between 3pm to 6pm. The art studio was closed, so he couldn't have been there during that time.

Wait, but the options are from 8am to 10am, 2pm to 3pm, 4pm to 6pm, and 3pm to 4pm. The art studio was closed after 6pm, so the latest he could have gone is before 6pm.

But he was at the library from 3pm to 4pm and then at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. So, he wasn't at the art studio during any of those times. The art studio was closed after 6pm, so he couldn't have gone after that.

Hmm, but the options don't include a time before 8am or after 6pm, so maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Andrew was at the electronics store until 2pm. Then, he went to the library from 3pm to 4pm and then to the deli from 4pm to 6pm. The art studio was closed after 6pm, so he couldn't have gone there after 6pm. But the art studio could have been open before 6pm.

Wait, the art studio was closed after 6pm, but it might have been open earlier. So, maybe he went to the art studio before 6pm.

But when was he free? He was at the electronics store from 8am to 2pm, then at the library from 3pm to 4pm, and then at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. So, between 2pm and 3pm, he was free. That's when he could have gone to the art studio.

So, the time between 2pm to 3pm is when he was free, and the art studio was still open then because it closed after 6pm.

Therefore, the correct time Andrew could have gone to the art studio is between 2pm to 3pm.

The correct time Andrew could have gone to the art studio is **2pm to 3pm**.

Answer: (B) 2pm to 3pm
