Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the premises provided. Let me start by reading the premises carefully.

Premise 1: Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China.
Premise 2: Beijing is the capital city of the world's most populous nation.
Premise 3: Beijing is located in Northern China.
Premise 4: Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games.
Premise 5: Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics.

The conclusion is: Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.

Alright, so first, I need to see if the conclusion can be logically deduced from the premises.

Looking at Premise 4: It says Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Paralympics. So that's two events: one Summer Olympics and one Summer Paralympics. 

Then Premise 5: It states that Beijing has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, as well as the Summer and Winter Paralympics. So that's two sets of events: Summer and Winter for both the Olympics and Paralympics.

Wait, so Premise 5 seems to be expanding on Premise 4. Premise 4 is a specific case (2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics), while Premise 5 is a more general statement that Beijing has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, and similarly for the Paralympics.

So, if Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics (part of the Summer Olympics), and also hosted the Winter Olympics, that would make the conclusion true because it's referring to both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.

But I need to make sure that the premises allow us to conclude that Beijing hosted both. Premise 5 says Beijing has hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. So that directly supports the conclusion.

However, I should check if there's any information that might contradict or make the conclusion uncertain. Let's see:

Premise 4 specifically mentions 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics. Premise 5 is about hosting both Summer and Winter Olympics, and both their Paralympics.

So, from Premise 5, we can infer that Beijing has hosted both Summer and Winter Olympics, and also both their respective Paralympics. So, that would mean Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics (as part of the Summer Olympics) and also the Winter Olympics (which could have been a different year, not necessarily 2008).

Therefore, the conclusion is directly supported by Premise 5, which states that Beijing hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. So, the conclusion is true.
</think>

The conclusion is true because Premise 5 explicitly states that Beijing hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics, directly supporting the assertion that Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.

**Answer:** True
