["initializing"]To determine the possible times Jessica could have visited the beach, let's analyze the information provided:["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]Jessica's Schedule: 
- 5am: Woke up.
- 5am to 8am: At a yoga studio (seen by Emily).
- 8am to 9am: Near the Eiffel Tower (seen by Thomas).
- 12pm to 3pm: At an electronic store (seen by Richard).
- 3pm to 7pm: At a theater (seen by Kimberly).
- 7pm to 10pm: Driving to a water park (seen by Sarah).
- After 10pm: Beach was closed.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Identifying Overlapping Times:
- 5am to 8am: Yoga studio.
- 8am to 9am: Eiffel Tower.
- 9am to 12pm: No direct sightings, but activities from 9am to 12pm aren't observed.
- 12pm to 3pm: Electronic store.
- 3pm to 7pm: Theater.
- 7pm to 10pm: Water park.
- After 10pm: Beach closed.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Possible Beach Visit Windows:
- 9am to 12pm: No direct sightings, but possible if Jessica wasn't seen during this time.
- 12pm to 3pm: At the electronic store, but the beach is not mentioned here.
- 3pm to 7pm: At the theater, but the beach isn't open yet.
- 7pm to 10pm: At the water park, but the beach is closed after 10pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"]Conclusion:
- The only plausible time when Jessica wasn't observed by anyone else and the beach was still open is between 9am to 12pm.["end-section"]
