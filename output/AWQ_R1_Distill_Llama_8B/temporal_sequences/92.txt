Alright, let's try to figure out between what times James could have gone to the market. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.

First, James woke up at 7am. So, his activities start from 7am onwards.

Next, David saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 7am to 8am. That means James was at the Eiffel Tower during that time.

Then, John saw James playing tennis at the tennis court from 10am to 1pm. So, James was occupied with tennis from 10am until 1pm.

After that, Elizabeth saw James waiting at the airport from 1pm to 3pm. So, he was at the airport during that period.

Finally, William saw James reading at the library from 3pm to 5pm. So, he was reading until 5pm.

The market was closed after 5pm, which suggests that the market's operating hours ended at 5pm. Therefore, James couldn't have gone to the market after 5pm because the market was closed by then.

Now, let's look at the times when James was not occupied with other activities:

- From 7am to 8am: James was taking photos.
- From 8am to 10am: There's a gap here. James wasn't doing anything mentioned here.
- From 10am to 1pm: He was playing tennis.
- From 1pm to 3pm: He was waiting at the airport.
- From 3pm to 5pm: He was reading at the library.

So, the only time James was free is between 8am and 10am.

The market was likely open during this free period, so James could have gone to the market between 8am and 10am.

Let me double-check the timeline to make sure I didn't miss anything:

- 7am to 8am: Photos
- 8am to 10am: Free
- 10am to 1pm: Tennis
- 1pm to 3pm: Airport
- 3pm to 5pm: Library

Yes, the only window when he was free is between 8am and 10am, which matches option (D).

So, the answer should be (D) 8am to 10am.

The correct answer is (D) 8am to 10am.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify James' schedule:**
   - Woke up at 7am.

   - Waited at the airport from 1pm to 3pm (Elizabeth's observation).
   - Read at the library from 3pm to 5pm (William's observation).

2. **Determine James' free times:**
   - Between 8am to 10am, James had no scheduled activities mentioned.

3. **Market operating hours:**
   - The market was closed after 5pm, so James could have visited before 5pm.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - James was free between 8am to 10am, which aligns with option (D).

**Answer:** (D) 8am to 10am
