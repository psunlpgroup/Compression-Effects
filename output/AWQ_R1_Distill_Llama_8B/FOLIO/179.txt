Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the conclusion that Susan flies from LGA airport is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the premise says: Susan flies to LGA airport. That means Susan is taking a flight that's going to LGA, which is an airport. So, she's departing from her current location to arrive at LGA.

Then, the second part of the premise mentions that the departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport. So, Susan isn't flying to the same place she's leaving from. That means if she's flying to LGA, she's definitely not departing from LGA. She's coming from a different airport.

Next, John flies from LGA airport. So, John is starting his flight from LGA, going somewhere else.

Now, the conclusion is that Susan flies from LGA airport. Wait, but from the premise, Susan is flying to LGA, not from there. So, Susan isn't leaving from LGA, she's arriving there. Therefore, the conclusion that she flies from LGA seems incorrect.

But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The premise says departure and arrival can't be at the same airport, so Susan isn't departing from LGA; she's arriving there. John is departing from LGA, but Susan isn't. So, the conclusion is trying to say Susan is flying from LGA, but the facts say she's flying to LGA. So, the conclusion is false.

**Answer:**

The conclusion that Susan flies from LGA airport is **false**. Based on the premise, Susan is flying to LGA, not from it. The premise also specifies that departure and arrival locations cannot be the same, confirming that Susan is arriving at LGA, not departing from it. Therefore, the conclusion is incorrect.
