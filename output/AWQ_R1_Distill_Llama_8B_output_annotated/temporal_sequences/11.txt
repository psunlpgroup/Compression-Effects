["initializing"] Alright, so I'm trying to figure out during which time Richard could have gone to the physics classroom. Let's break down the information step by step. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, Richard wakes up at 7am. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, he starts his day at 7am. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Now, let's look at what different people saw Richard doing throughout the day: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - **David** saw Richard at the library from **10am to 11am**.
- **Samantha** saw Richard on a rooftop from **11am to 2pm**.
- **Ashley** saw Richard working at the office from **2pm to 4pm**.
- **Hannah** saw Richard fixing their computer at the electronic store from **4pm to 8pm**. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] The physics classroom was closed after **8pm**, so Richard likely couldn't have gone there after 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, let's piece this together. Richard starts his day at 7am. The first time anyone saw him is at **10am** in the library. That means Richard was at the library from 10am to 11am. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] After that, Samantha saw him on the rooftop from 11am to 2pm. So, Richard was either at the library, on the rooftop, or doing other things in between. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Next, Ashley saw him at the office from 2pm to 4pm. So, between 2pm and 4pm, Richard was working at the office. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Then, Hannah saw him at the electronics store from 4pm to 8pm. So, after leaving the office, Richard went to the store, where he stayed until 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, the question is: Between what times could Richard have gone to the physics classroom? ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The physics classroom was closed after 8pm, so Richard likely couldn't have gone there after 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Looking at Richard's schedule: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - **7am to 10am**: Richard was likely at home since David didn't see him yet.
- **10am to 11am**: He was at the library.
- **11am to 2pm**: He was on the rooftop.
- **2pm to 4pm**: He was at the office.
- **4pm to 8pm**: He was at the electronics store. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Since the physics classroom was closed after 8pm, Richard couldn't have gone there after that time. Therefore, the latest he could have gone is before 8pm. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Now, looking at the options: ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] - **(A) 7am to 10am**: This is before David saw him at the library. It's possible, but he was likely at home. ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] - **(B) 2pm to 4pm**: He was at the office during this time, so he wasn't at the physics classroom. ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] - **(C) 11am to 2pm**: He was on the rooftop during this time. ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] - **(D) 4pm to 8pm**: He was at the electronics store during this time. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] None of these options directly indicate he was at the physics classroom. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] However, since the physics classroom was closed after 8pm, Richard could have potentially gone there at any time before 8pm, but based on the given sightings, the only time he wasn't seen by anyone else is between 7am to 10am and potentially before 11am. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But since the question asks between what times could he have gone, considering the options, **(D) 4pm to 8pm** is when he was at the store, but the classroom was closed after 8pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, he could have gone to the classroom during that time, but after 8pm, it's closed. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] However, looking at the options, **(D)** is the only one that aligns with the time he was at the store, which is also the time the classroom was still open. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the correct answer is **(D)**. ["end-section"]
