To determine Nintendo's limit on games per developer per year for the platform supporting the video game named after the sports organization responsible for the Super Bowl halftime show, we first identify the relevant sports organization.

The Super Bowl halftime show is typically organized by the NFL (National Football League), so the video game is likely named "NFL." Nintendo's platform, such as the Nintendo Switch, has a limit on the number of games a developer can release annually.

However, specific details about this limit are not publicly disclosed by Nintendo, so the exact number cannot be confirmed.
