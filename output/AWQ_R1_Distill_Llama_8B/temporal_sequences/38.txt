Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the coffee shop. So, the timeline we have is as follows:

- **8am**: David wakes up.
- **10am - 1pm**: Elizabeth sees David waiting at the airport.
- **1pm - 2pm**: David is playing tennis.
- **2pm - 3pm**: Jessica sees David working out at the gym.
- **3pm - 4pm**: Susan sees David waiting at the train station.
- **4pm - 6pm**: Sean sees David sitting on a rooftop.
- **After 6pm**: The coffee shop is closed.

First, let's list out all the times when David is occupied and where he is:

1. **8am - ?**: Woke up.
2. **10am - 1pm**: At the airport.
3. **1pm - 2pm**: Playing tennis.
4. **2pm - 3pm**: Working out at the gym.
5. **3pm - 4pm**: At the train station.
6. **4pm - 6pm**: On the rooftop.
7. **After 6pm**: Coffee shop is closed.

So, the coffee shop is only open until 6pm. After that, it's closed, and David can't go there anymore.

Now, let's see when David is free. He wakes up at 8am. Between 8am and 10am, he's free because the next activity is him waiting at the airport from 10am to 1pm.

So, between 8am and 10am, he could go to the coffee shop.

Next, after 1pm, he's occupied until 6pm with various activities. So, the only free time is from 8am to 10am.

Looking at the options:

- **(A) 3pm to 4pm**: He's at the train station during this time.
- **(B) 10am to 1pm**: He's at the airport.
- **(C) 8am to 10am**: This is when he's free before his next activity.
- **(D) 1pm to 2pm**: He's playing tennis.

So, the only time he's free is between 8am and 10am, which is option **(C)**.

Therefore, David could have gone to the coffee shop between **8am and 10am**.

**Answer: (C)**
