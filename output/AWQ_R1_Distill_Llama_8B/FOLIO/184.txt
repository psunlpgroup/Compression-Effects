Okay, so I need to figure out whether Dani Shapiro is a novel writer based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information provided.

First, the premise states that a podcast is not a novel. That's a clear statement, so I can use that information later.

Next, there are several if-then statements. Let me list them out:

1. If a person is born in American City, the person is American.
2. If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.
3. Dani Shapiro is an American writer.
4. Family History is written by Dani Shapiro.
5. Family History is a novel written in 2003.
6. Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets.
7. Boston is an American city.

I need to connect these statements to see if they lead to the conclusion that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.

Starting with point 7: Boston is an American city. From premise 1: If a person is born in American City, the person is American. Wait, but Boston is a city, and American City is mentioned as a place where people are born. So, does this mean that if someone is born in Boston, they are American? But the premise says "American City," not Boston specifically. Hmm, maybe I should think of Boston as an example of an American city. So, if someone is born in Boston, which is an American city, then they are American. But the premise doesn't explicitly say that; it says if someone is born in American City, they are American. So, Boston being an American city might not directly tie into the first premise unless we assume that Boston is the American City in question. Maybe that's a stretch, but I think it's safe to consider that since Boston is an American city, anyone born there would be American.

Moving on to point 3: Dani Shapiro is an American writer. Since we established that if someone is born in American City, they are American, and Dani Shapiro is a writer, but we don't know where she was born yet. Wait, but we have another point: Family History is written by Dani Shapiro. And Family History is a novel written in 2003. So, if Family History is a novel written by Dani Shapiro, does that mean she is a novel writer? Let's look at point 2: If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer. So, if Family History is a novel written by Dani Shapiro, then Dani Shapiro is a novel writer. That seems straightforward.

But wait, is Family History a novel? Point 5 says Family History is a novel written in 2003. So yes, it's a novel. Therefore, applying point 2, since it's a novel written by Dani Shapiro, she must be a novel writer. So, that directly leads to the conclusion that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.

But wait, there's also point 6: Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets. The premise says a podcast is not a novel. So, does that affect anything? It seems like it's just additional information about her work, but since Family History is a novel, and the podcast is a different thing, it doesn't negate her being a novel writer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The conclusion is that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer, which we concluded based on point 2. Is there any reason to doubt that? Let me check again.

Premise 1: If born in American City, then American. Dani Shapiro is an American writer (point 3). If she's an American writer, does that mean she was born in American City? Well, not necessarily, because being an American writer could mean she's an American citizen, regardless of where she was born. So, premise 1 might not be necessary here unless we need it for something else.

Wait, but the conclusion is about her being a novel writer, which is directly supported by point 2, so premise 1 might not be needed for this conclusion. However, it's possible that the user wants to consider all premises, so maybe there's a step I'm missing.

Wait, another angle: Is Family History written by Dani Shapiro a novel? Yes, from point 5. So, using point 2, since it's a novel written by her, she is a novel writer. So, the conclusion is directly supported.

But let me think if there's any way that the conclusion could be uncertain. For example, is there any possibility that Family History isn't a novel? But point 5 says it is. So, that's solid.

Alternatively, is there a possibility that Dani Shapiro didn't write Family History? No, point 4 says she did.

Therefore, putting it all together, the conclusion that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer is true based on the premises.
