["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Sarah could have gone to the art studio. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] So, here's what we know from the timeline: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Sarah wakes up at 9am.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] That's her starting point. So, her activities begin at 9am. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Richard saw Sarah buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 12pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Okay, so from 9am to 12pm, Sarah is at the bike shop. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] That means she's not at the art studio during this time. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Betty saw Sarah waiting at the train station from 12pm to 1pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] After buying the bike, Sarah goes to the train station and waits there from 12pm to 1pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, she's not at the art studio during this period either. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Michael saw Sarah buying clothes at the mall from 1pm to 3pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Next, Sarah is at the mall buying clothes from 1pm to 3pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, she's occupied there, not at the art studio. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Jennifer saw Sarah working out at the gym from 3pm to 6pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] After the mall, Sarah goes to the gym to work out. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] She's there from 3pm to 6pm. So, no time at the art studio during this period. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **Hannah saw Sarah buying a phone at the electronics store from 6pm to 8pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] At 6pm, Sarah is at the electronics store buying a phone. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] She stays there until 8pm. So, again, no time at the art studio. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] **The art studio was closed after 10pm.** ["end-section"]

["deduction"] This is important because it tells us the latest time Sarah could have gone to the art studio. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Now, let's piece this together: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - Sarah starts her day at 9am.
- From 9am to 12pm: Bike shop.
- 12pm to 1pm: Train station.
- 1pm to 3pm: Mall.
- 3pm to 6pm: Gym.
- 6pm to 8pm: Electronics store. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, when is she free? After 8pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] But the art studio is closed after 10pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, she must have gone after 8pm but before 10pm. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Looking at the options:

(A) 9am to 12pm: She's at the bike shop, so no.

(B) 3pm to 6pm: She's at the gym, so no.

(C) 12pm to 1pm: She's at the train station, so no.

(D) 8pm to 10pm: This fits because she's free after 8pm and the art studio is open until 10pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the correct time Sarah could have gone to the art studio is between 8pm and 10pm. ["end-section"]
