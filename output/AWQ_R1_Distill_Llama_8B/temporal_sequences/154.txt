Okay, let's try to figure out when Mark could have gone to the basketball court. 

First, let's list out all the information we have:

1. **Mark's schedule:**
   - Woke up at **12pm**.
   - Saw buying clothes at the mall from **12pm to 1pm** by James.
   - Then saw driving to the water park from **1pm to 4pm** by Nancy.
   - After that, saw sitting on a rooftop from **5pm to 6pm** by Richard.
   - Later, saw getting a coffee at the cafe from **6pm to 10pm** by John.
   - The basketball court was closed after **10pm**.

2. **Basketball court availability:**
   - Closed after **10pm**, so Mark must have gone before 10pm.

Now, let's analyze Mark's activities step by step:

- From **12pm to 1pm**, Mark was buying clothes at the mall.
- From **1pm to 4pm**, he was driving to the water park.
- So, he couldn't have been at the basketball court during these times because he was either shopping or driving.
  
Next, after arriving at the water park around **4pm**, he might have gone inside, but we don't have information about his exact movements after that until **5pm** when Richard saw him sitting on a rooftop from **5pm to 6pm**.

Then, from **6pm to 10pm**, he was getting a coffee at the cafe. So, again, he wasn't at the basketball court during this time.

Since the basketball court was closed after **10pm**, Mark must have gone before **10pm**. But based on the timeline, he was either shopping, driving, sitting on a rooftop, or getting coffee until **10pm**.

There's a gap between **4pm to 5pm** when he was likely at the water park or traveling to it. However, we don't have any sightings of him at the basketball court during this period.

Therefore, the only possible time he could have gone to the basketball court is during the **4pm to 5pm** window when he wasn't seen by anyone else.

**Answer:** (C) 4pm to 5pm
