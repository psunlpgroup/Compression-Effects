["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out when Andrew could have gone to the art studio. ["end-section"] ["initializing"] I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, Andrew wakes up at 8am. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] That's his starting point. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Then, Richard saw Andrew buying a phone at the electronics store from 8am to 10am. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, Richard saw Andrew between 8am and 10am. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, Samantha saw Andrew fixing their computer at the same electronics store from 10am to 2pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, Samantha's time overlaps with Richard's time a bit, from 10am to 10am when the phone purchase happened, and then from 10am to 2pm for the computer fix. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, Michael saw Andrew reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, Michael's observation is later in the day. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, Sarah's time overlaps with Michael's time, from 4pm to 4pm when Michael saw him reading, and then from 4pm to 6pm for lunch. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The art studio was closed after 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] That means Andrew couldn't have gone to the art studio after 6pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, let's piece this together. Andrew was at the electronics store from 8am to 2pm, as seen by Richard and Samantha. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Then, after that, Michael saw him at the library from 3pm to 4pm, and Sarah saw him buying lunch from 4pm to 6pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Since the art studio was closed after 6pm, Andrew couldn't have gone there after 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] But he was at the library and deli between 3pm to 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The art studio was closed, so he couldn't have been there during that time. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but the options are from 8am to 10am, 2pm to 3pm, 4pm to 6pm, and 3pm to 4pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The art studio was closed after 6pm, so the latest he could have gone is before 6pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But he was at the library from 3pm to 4pm and then at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, he wasn't at the art studio during any of those times. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The art studio was closed after 6pm, so he couldn't have gone after that. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Hmm, but the options don't include a time before 8am or after 6pm, so maybe I missed something. ["end-section"] ["backtracking"] Let me check again. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Andrew was at the electronics store until 2pm. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Then, he went to the library from 3pm to 4pm and then to the deli from 4pm to 6pm. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] The art studio was closed after 6pm, so he couldn't have gone there after 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] But the art studio could have been open before 6pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, the art studio was closed after 6pm, but it might have been open earlier. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, maybe he went to the art studio before 6pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But when was he free? ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] He was at the electronics store from 8am to 2pm, then at the library from 3pm to 4pm, and then at the deli from 4pm to 6pm. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, between 2pm and 3pm, he was free. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] That's when he could have gone to the art studio. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the time between 2pm to 3pm is when he was free, and the art studio was still open then because it closed after 6pm. ["end-section"]
