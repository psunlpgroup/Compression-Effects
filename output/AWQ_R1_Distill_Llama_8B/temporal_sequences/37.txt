Alright, so I need to figure out between what times James could have gone to the dance studio. Let me start by laying out all the information given.

First, James woke up at 7am. That's his starting point. Then, there are several people who saw James at different places at different times:

- **Thomas** saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 7am to 12pm.
- **Mark** saw James driving to the water park from 12pm to 2pm.
- **Anthony** saw James buying a phone at the electronics store from 2pm to 4pm.
- **Sarah** saw James buying lunch at the deli from 5pm to 6pm.

Additionally, it's mentioned that the dance studio was closed after 6pm. So, the dance studio was open before 6pm, but not after.

Now, I need to determine during which time window James could have visited the dance studio. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **From 7am to 12pm**: Thomas saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. So, James was busy taking photos during this time. That means James wasn't at the dance studio during this window.

2. **From 12pm to 2pm**: Mark saw James driving to the water park. So, James was occupied going to the water park during this time. Again, no chance he was at the dance studio.

3. **From 2pm to 4pm**: Anthony saw James buying a phone at the electronics store. So, James was busy buying a phone during this period. No time here for the dance studio.

4. **From 5pm to 6pm**: Sarah saw James buying lunch at the deli. So, James was occupied buying lunch during this time. The dance studio was closed after 6pm, so even if he had time after 6pm, the studio was already closed.

Wait a minute, none of these times align with the dance studio being available. The dance studio was closed after 6pm, so before 6pm, it was open. But James was occupied from 7am to 6pm without any breaks according to the observations.

Let me double-check:

- 7am to 12pm: Eiffel Tower photos
- 12pm to 2pm: Water park driving
- 2pm to 4pm: Electronics store
- 5pm to 6pm: Deli lunch

So, James was busy the entire time from 7am to 6pm. That leaves no time for him to go to the dance studio. But wait, the question says "Between what times could they have gone?" implying that there is a possible time.

Maybe I missed something. Let me think again.

The dance studio was closed after 6pm, but it was open before that. So, if James had a free moment before 6pm, he could have gone. But looking at his schedule:

- From 7am to 12pm: occupied
- 12pm to 2pm: occupied
- 2pm to 4pm: occupied
- 5pm to 6pm: occupied

So, no free time before 6pm. Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio on the same day.

Wait, but the options given are:

(A) 2pm to 4pm
(B) 7am to 12pm
(C) 4pm to 5pm
(D) 12pm to 2pm

Hmm, none of these align with the dance studio time, which would require a different time. But the options don't include a time before 7am or after 6pm, which is when the dance studio was open.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the timeline. The dance studio was closed after 6pm, so it was open before 6pm. James was seen by others from 7am to 6pm. So, if he had a free moment during that time, he could have gone to the studio.

But according to the observations, he was occupied the entire time from 7am to 6pm. Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio on that day.

But the question is asking "Between what times could they have gone?" implying that there is a possible time.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the dance studio was closed after 6pm, but it was open before that. So, if James had a free moment before 6pm, he could have gone.

But according to the given observations, James was occupied the entire time from 7am to 6pm. Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio on that day.

But the options don't include a time before 7am or after 6pm, which is when the dance studio was open.

Wait, maybe the dance studio was open before 7am? But James woke up at 7am, so before that, he was asleep.

Alternatively, perhaps the dance studio was open after 6pm, but the statement says it was closed after 6pm. So, it was open before 6pm.

But James was seen by others from 7am to 6pm, so he was occupied the entire time.

Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio on that day.

But the question is asking "Between what times could they have gone?" So, perhaps the correct answer is that he couldn't have gone at all, but since the options don't include that, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the times again.

- 7am to 12pm: Eiffel Tower
- 12pm to 2pm: Water park driving
- 2pm to 4pm: Electronics store
- 5pm to 6pm: Deli lunch

So, between 4pm and 5pm, where was James? He was buying a phone until 4pm and then buying lunch from 5pm to 6pm. So, from 4pm to 5pm, he was transitioning from the electronics store to the deli. Maybe he had a brief window there.

But according to the given options, (C) is 4pm to 5pm. So, maybe that's when he could have gone to the dance studio.

But the problem is that he was buying a phone until 4pm and then buying lunch from 5pm to 6pm. So, the time between 4pm and 5pm, he was still occupied.

Wait, but perhaps the time between 4pm and 5pm was when he was free. Maybe he finished buying the phone at 4pm and then went to the deli at 5pm. So, the time between 4pm and 5pm, he was free.

Therefore, he could have gone to the dance studio during that time.

So, the answer would be (C) 4pm to 5pm.

But I'm not entirely sure because the transition time isn't specified. However, given the options, (C) seems plausible.
</think>

The dance studio was closed after 6pm, so James could have visited between 4pm and 5pm before he went to buy lunch.

**Answer:** (C) 4pm to 5pm
