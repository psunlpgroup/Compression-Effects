["initializing"] Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion "All squares are shapes." is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break this down step by step. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, the premises are: 1. All squares are four-sided. 2. All four-sided things are shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] I need to see if these premises logically lead to the conclusion. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Starting with the first premise: All squares have four sides. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] That makes sense because a square is a quadrilateral with equal sides and angles. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, if something is a square, it must have four sides. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] The second premise says that all four-sided things are shapes. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] A shape is a two-dimensional figure, like a polygon or a circle. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, if something is four-sided, it falls under the category of shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, connecting these two premises. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] If all squares are four-sided, and all four-sided things are shapes, then by substitution, all squares must be shapes. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] That seems straightforward. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] I don't see any contradictions here. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Squares are indeed four-sided, and four-sided things are shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] I don't think there's any uncertainty here because the premises are clear and directly related. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] There's no hidden information or exceptions mentioned, so the conclusion should be true. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 1. **Premise 1:** All squares are four-sided. This defines squares as quadrilaterals with four sides. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] 2. **Premise 2:** All four-sided things are shapes. This includes all four-sided figures under the category of shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 3. **Logical Connection:** Since all squares are four-sided (from Premise 1) and all four-sided things are shapes (from Premise 2), substituting the first into the second logically leads to the conclusion that all squares are shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, All squares are shapes. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] **Answer:** True ["end-section"]
