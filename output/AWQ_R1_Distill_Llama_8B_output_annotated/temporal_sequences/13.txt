["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out when Betty could have gone to the art show. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Okay, so we have several people who saw Betty doing different things at different times. I need to piece this together. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] First, Betty woke up at 8am. So that's the earliest time she was active today. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, Elizabeth saw Betty buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am. So, during that time, Betty was at the deli. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] That means she wasn't at the art show during 8-10am. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] After that, Tiffany saw Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, from 10am to 1pm, Betty was busy with the computer. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] She wasn't at the art show during that time either. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Next, Susan saw Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, from 1pm to 2pm, Betty was taking photos. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] She wasn't at the art show then. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, Betty saw herself getting a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, from 7pm to 10pm, she was at the cafe. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The art show was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone after 10pm. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Now, I need to find the times when Betty wasn't doing any of those things to figure out when she could have gone to the art show. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let's list out the times: ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] - 8am to 10am: At deli (Elizabeth saw her) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] - 10am to 1pm: Fixing computer (Tiffany saw her) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] - 1pm to 2pm: Taking photos (Susan saw her) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] - 7pm to 10pm: Getting coffee (Betty saw herself) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the times when Betty wasn't doing those things are: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - Between 2pm to 7pm ["end-section"]

["deduction"] That's the only time when she wasn't seen doing anything specific, so that's when she could have gone to the art show. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Looking at the options: ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (A) 2pm to 7pm ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (B) 7pm to 10pm ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (C) 8am to 10am ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (D) 1pm to 2pm ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the correct answer is (A) 2pm to 7pm. ["end-section"]
