Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the premise. Let me start by understanding the premises and the conclusion.

The premise says that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician. He was also a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag. So, he served in two different legislative bodies.

Now, the conclusion is: "Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag." 

I need to determine if this conclusion is necessarily true, false, or if there's uncertainty.

First, I know that the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag were both legislative bodies, but in different contexts. The Prussian State Parliament was a part of the Weimar Republic, which was the government before the Nazis, whereas the Nazi Reichstag was the parliament under the Nazis.

Heinrich Schmidt was a member of both, so that means at least one German politician was in both. The conclusion is making a general statement that "some" German politician was in both, which seems to be supported by the fact that Heinrich Schmidt was.

Wait, but does "some" mean exactly one, or at least one? In logic, "some" means at least one. So if at least one exists, the statement is true.

But I should check if there's any possibility that the premise doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion. The premise says Heinrich Schmidt was a member of both. So, that's a specific case. The conclusion is a general statement that there exists at least one such politician.

So, logically, if one exists, then the statement "some" is true. Therefore, the conclusion is true.

I don't see any logical flaw here. The premise directly implies the conclusion because the existence of one example satisfies the "some" condition.

Wait, but could there be more than one? The premise only mentions Heinrich Schmidt, but it's possible that there were others. However, the conclusion only requires the existence of at least one, so it doesn't matter if there are more. The conclusion would still hold.

So, yes, the conclusion is true.
</think>

The conclusion is true because the premise establishes that at least one German politician, Heinrich Schmidt, was a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag. The logical term "some" in the conclusion means that at least one instance is sufficient to validate the statement, which aligns with the provided information.

**Answer:** True
