Alright, so I need to figure out if the conclusion that ETS provides financial aid to Tom is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the premise. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300. That's straightforward. Then, ETS (which I think is the Educational Testing Service, the people who run the GRE) provides financial aid to applicants who prove they have economic hardship. Okay, so if you can show you can't afford the $300, they might help you cover some of the cost, making it cheaper, like $205.

Next, the premise mentions that people living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship. So, if you're in a single-parent household or struggling financially, you can apply for aid. Now, Tom is applying to take the GRE. He lives in a single-parent family, and his dad has been out of work, leaving him with few resources available. So, based on the information provided, Tom meets the criteria for economic hardship because he's in a single-parent family and has limited resources.

Putting this together, since Tom meets the criteria for economic hardship, he should be able to prove it and thus receive financial aid from ETS. That would make the GRE test cheaper for him, specifically $205. The conclusion is stating that ETS provides financial aid to Tom, which seems to follow logically from the premise.

I don't see any gaps in the reasoning. The premise clearly links economic hardship to financial aid, and Tom's situation fits that description. There's no information suggesting that Tom doesn't qualify or that ETS wouldn't provide aid in his case. Therefore, the conclusion should be true.
