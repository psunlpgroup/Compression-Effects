Alright, let's try to figure out when Ashley could have gone to the orchestra hall. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how the times overlap.

Ashley wakes up at 5am. Susan sees Ashley waiting at the airport from 5am to 6am. So, that's the first window when Ashley is visible to Susan.

Next, Thomas saw Ashley taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 9am. Hmm, so that's later in the morning.

Mark saw Ashley watching a movie at the theater from 9am to 1pm. That's a significant chunk of time in the morning and early afternoon.

Sarah saw Ashley walking in the garden from 1pm to 4pm. So, that's the afternoon.

Nancy saw Ashley working out at the gym from 4pm to 9pm. That's the evening.

The orchestra hall was closed after 9pm, so Ashley couldn't have gone after that time.

Now, I need to see when Ashley was free to go to the orchestra hall. Let's see:

- From 5am to 6am: Ashley is at the airport, so that's busy.
- From 6am to 7am: There's no information, so maybe Ashley was free? But Thomas saw Ashley at 7am, so maybe she was busy taking photos from 7am.
- From 7am to 9am: She's taking photos, so that's busy.
- From 9am to 1pm: She's watching a movie, so that's busy.
- From 1pm to 4pm: She's walking in the garden, so that's busy.
- From 4pm to 9pm: She's at the gym, so that's busy.

Wait, so the only time Ashley wasn't seen by others is between 6am to 7am. That's a one-hour window. So, could she have gone to the orchestra hall then?

But the orchestra hall was closed after 9pm, so she couldn't have gone after 9pm. But 6am to 7am is before 9pm, so maybe that's possible.

But let me check the options:

(A) 6am to 7am
(B) 1pm to 4pm
(C) 7am to 9am
(D) 4pm to 9pm

From the timeline, 6am to 7am is the only free time. So, the correct answer is (A) 6am to 7am.

But wait, the orchestra hall was closed after 9pm. So, if she went after 9pm, she couldn't have entered. But 6am to 7am is before 9pm, so that's okay.

So, yes, she could have gone between 6am and 7am.

**Answer: (A) 6am to 7am**
