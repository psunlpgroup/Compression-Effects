Alright, let's try to figure out when Jason could have gone to the basketball court. 

First, let's list out what we know:

1. **Jason's timeline:**
   - Woke up at **8am**.
   - Was at the electronic store from **8am to 10am** (according to Hannah).
   - Then, was at the mall from **10am to 11am** (according to Sarah).
   - After that, walked in the garden from **11am to 3pm** (according to Thomas).
   - Sat on a rooftop from **3pm to 7pm** (according to Linda).
   - Then, walked towards the Statue of Liberty from **7pm to 9pm** (according to Mark).
   - The basketball court was closed after **10pm**.

2. **Basketball court hours:**
   - We don't have specific opening hours, but it was closed after **10pm**.

Now, let's see when Jason could have possibly gone to the basketball court.

- Between **8am to 10am**, Jason was at the electronic store. So, he couldn't have gone to the basketball court during this time.
  
- From **10am to 11am**, he was at the mall. Again, no time for the basketball court.

- From **11am to 3pm**, he was walking in the garden. So, no basketball court visit here either.

- From **3pm to 7pm**, he was sitting on a rooftop. So, no basketball court visit.

- From **7pm to 9pm**, he was walking towards the Statue of Liberty. He might have been close to the basketball court during this time, but we don't have any information that directly links him to the basketball court during this period.

- After **9pm**, the next activity would be him potentially visiting the basketball court. However, we know the basketball court was closed after **10pm**. So, if he went after **9pm**, he would have to leave before **10pm**.

But wait, we don't have any direct information about him being at the basketball court during these times. The only time when he could potentially have gone is between **9pm to 10pm**, right after he was seen walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

So, the only possible time he could have gone to the basketball court is between **9pm to 10pm**.

But let's double-check the options given:

- **(A) 3pm to 7pm**: He was on the rooftop during this time, so no.
- **(B) 8am to 10am**: He was at the electronic store, so no.
- **(C) 9pm to 10pm**: This aligns with our reasoning.
- **(D) 10am to 11am**: He was at the mall, so no.

Therefore, the correct answer should be **(C) 9pm to 10pm**.
</think>

The correct answer is **(C) 9pm to 10pm**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Jason's schedule:**
   - **8am - 10am:** Electronic store
   - **10am - 11am:** Mall
   - **11am - 3pm:** Garden
   - **3pm - 7pm:** Rooftop
   - **7pm - 9pm:** Walking towards the Statue of Liberty
   - **After 9pm:** Basketball court was closed by 10pm

2. **Determine possible times for basketball court visit:**
   - The only free time after **9pm** is **9pm to 10pm**, as the court closes afterward.

3. **Match with options:**
   - **(C) 9pm to 10pm** is the only feasible time.

**Answer:** (C) 9pm to 10pm
