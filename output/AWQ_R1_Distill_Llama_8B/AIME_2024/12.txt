Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. Hmm, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the time it takes for each, including the time she spends in the coffee shop, which is the same in both cases.

First, let me note down the given information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of \( s \) km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including the \( t \) minutes.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the total time for each walk includes both the walking time and the time spent in the coffee shop. So, if I can find the walking time in each case, I can subtract the coffee shop time \( t \) to get the actual walking time, and then use that to find the speed.

Wait, actually, hold on. Let me think. The total time given is the walking time plus the coffee time. So, in the first case, she walks 9 km at speed \( s \), taking 4 hours total, which includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. Similarly, in the second case, she walks 9 km at \( s + 2 \) km/h, taking 2 hours and 24 minutes total, which also includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.

So, in both cases, the total time is walking time plus \( t \) minutes. So, if I can find the walking time in each case, I can relate it to the speed.

Let me convert the times into hours because the speeds are in km per hour.

First case: Total time = 4 hours. This includes both walking time and coffee time. So, walking time = Total time - Coffee time.

But wait, the coffee time is given as \( t \) minutes. So, I need to convert \( t \) minutes into hours to keep the units consistent.

Let me denote \( t \) minutes as \( t \) minutes, but since the speeds are in km/h, it's better to convert everything into hours.

So, let me convert 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes into hours.

First case:

Total time = 4 hours. So, that's already in hours.

Walking time = Total time - Coffee time.

But Coffee time is \( t \) minutes, which is \( t/60 \) hours.

So, walking time = 4 - \( t/60 \) hours.

Similarly, in the second case:

Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours.

24 minutes is \( 24/60 = 0.4 \) hours, so total time is \( 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 \) hours.

So, walking time = Total time - Coffee time = 2.4 - \( t/60 \) hours.

Now, I can relate walking time to speed because walking distance is 9 km in both cases.

Recall that walking time = distance / speed.

So, in the first case:

Walking time = 9 km / \( s \) km/h = 9/s hours.

But we also have walking time = 4 - \( t/60 \) hours.

So, equating the two:

9/s = 4 - \( t/60 \). Let me write this as equation (1):

\( 9/s = 4 - t/60 \).

Similarly, in the second case:

Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

But we also have walking time = 2.4 - \( t/60 \) hours.

So, equating the two:

9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60. Let me write this as equation (2):

\( 9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60 \).

So now, I have two equations:

1. \( 9/s = 4 - t/60 \)
2. \( 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60 \)

Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables: \( s \) and \( t \). I can solve for these variables.

Let me denote \( t \) as some variable, say \( t \) minutes. But since we have \( t \) in both equations, let me see if I can express \( t \) from equation (1) and plug it into equation (2).

From equation (1):

\( 9/s = 4 - t/60 \)

So, let me solve for \( t \):

\( t/60 = 4 - 9/s \)

Multiply both sides by 60:

\( t = 60*(4 - 9/s) \)

So, \( t = 240 - 540/s \). Let me denote this as equation (1a).

Similarly, from equation (2):

\( 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60 \)

Again, solve for \( t \):

\( t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2) \)

Multiply both sides by 60:

\( t = 144 - 540/(s + 2) \). Let me denote this as equation (2a).

Now, since both expressions equal \( t \), I can set them equal to each other:

240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s + 2)

So, 240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s + 2)

Simplify the left side: 240 - 144 = 96.

Right side: 540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 540*((s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2))) = 540*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 1080/(s(s + 2)).

So, now we have:

96 = 1080/(s(s + 2))

So, let me solve for \( s(s + 2) \):

s(s + 2) = 1080 / 96

Calculate 1080 / 96:

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 1080 / 24 = 45, 96 / 24 = 4.

So, 45 / 4 = 11.25.

Wait, no, 1080 / 96: Let me compute it directly.

96 * 11 = 1056

1080 - 1056 = 24

So, 11 + 24/96 = 11 + 0.25 = 11.25

Yes, so 1080 / 96 = 11.25

Thus, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, quadratic equation in s.

Let me write it as:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

To solve for s, use quadratic formula.

s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2

Wait, discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 4 + 45 = 49.

So, sqrt(49) = 7.

Thus, s = [-2 ± 7]/2

So, two solutions:

s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h

But speed cannot be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

So, Aya's walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find \( t \) using equation (1a):

t = 240 - 540/s

Plug in s = 2.5:

t = 240 - 540 / 2.5

Compute 540 / 2.5:

540 / 2.5 = 540 * (2/5) = (540 / 5) * 2 = 108 * 2 = 216

So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, the coffee shop time is 24 minutes.

Now, the question asks for the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including the \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.

So, first, compute the new speed: \( s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h.

Now, compute the walking time: distance / speed = 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

But this walking time is in hours, so convert it to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

But this includes the coffee shop time \( t \), which is 24 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, in the original problem, when she walks at speed \( s \), the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking time and coffee shop time.

Similarly, when she walks at \( s + 2 \), the total time is 2.4 hours, which includes both walking time and coffee shop time.

So, when she walks at \( s + 1/2 \), the total time will be walking time + coffee shop time.

So, in this case, we need to compute the total time, which is walking time plus \( t \).

Wait, but in the previous two cases, the total time included both walking and coffee. So, in this problem, when she walks at \( s + 1/2 \), the total time is walking time + \( t \).

So, perhaps, we need to compute the walking time at 3 km/h, then add \( t = 24 \) minutes.

So, walking time at 3 km/h: 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Convert that to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Add coffee time: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, total walk time is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me verify that.

Wait, in the first case, when she walks at 2.5 km/h, total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, 240 minutes = walking time + 24 minutes coffee.

So, walking time is 240 - 24 = 216 minutes? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, in the first case, she walks 9 km at 2.5 km/h, which takes 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3.6 * 60 = 216 minutes.

So, total time including coffee shop is 240 minutes, so 216 + 24 = 240. That makes sense.

Similarly, when she walks at 4.5 km/h (which is s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5), the walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Total time including coffee shop is 2.4 hours, which is 144 minutes. So, 120 + 24 = 144. That also checks out.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Adding coffee time, 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Therefore, the total walk time is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me just verify once again.

Given that when speed is 2.5 km/h, total time is 4 hours (240 minutes) including 24 minutes coffee. So, walking time is 240 - 24 = 216 minutes.

Similarly, when speed is 4.5 km/h, total time is 2.4 hours (144 minutes) including 24 minutes coffee. So, walking time is 144 - 24 = 120 minutes.

So, walking time at 2.5 km/h is 216 minutes, at 4.5 km/h is 120 minutes.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, which is between 2.5 and 4.5, the walking time should be between 120 and 216 minutes.

But, 3 km/h is a moderate speed, so 3 hours is 180 minutes, which is between 120 and 216. So, that seems reasonable.

Thus, adding 24 minutes coffee, total time is 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Let me recast the problem:

We have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - t/60
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

We solved for s and t, got s = 2.5 km/h, t = 24 minutes.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, which is s + 0.5, the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

Adding the coffee time, 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the total time is 204 minutes.

**Final Answer**
The number of minutes the walk takes her is \boxed{204}.
</think>

Given that Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward, we need to find the total time she takes when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, including the \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop.

First, we convert the given times into hours and set up the equations based on the walking times and speeds:

1. When she walks at \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. Converting 4 hours to hours is straightforward, and the walking time is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{t}{60}
   \]
2. When she walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60}
   \]

We solve these equations for \( s \) and \( t \):

From the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s} = 4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
t = 60 \left(4 - \frac{9}{s}\right)
\]
\[
t = 240 - \frac{540}{s}
\]

From the second equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
t = 60 \left(2.4 - \frac{9}{s + 2}\right)
\]
\[
t = 144 - \frac{540}{s + 2}
\]

Setting the two expressions for \( t \) equal:
\[
240 - \frac{540}{s} = 144 - \frac{540}{s + 2}
\]
\[
96 = \frac{1080}{s(s + 2)}
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
\[
s = 2.5 \text{ km/h (since speed cannot be negative)}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) back to find \( t \):
\[
t = 240 - \frac{540}{2.5} = 240 - 216 = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

When she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding the coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the number of minutes the walk takes her is \(\boxed{204}\).
