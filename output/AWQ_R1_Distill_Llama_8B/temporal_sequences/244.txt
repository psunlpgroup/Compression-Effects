Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Elizabeth could have gone to the bakery. I'll need to look at all the information given and piece it together step by step.

First, I know that Elizabeth woke up at 5am. That's her starting point. Then, Jennifer saw Elizabeth on a rooftop from 5am to 6am. So, she was there during that time. Next, William saw her at school from 6am to 7am. So, she was busy from 6am to 7am.

Then, Thomas saw her stretching at a yoga studio from 7am to 11am. That means she was there from 7am until 11am. After that, Sarah saw Elizabeth waiting at the airport from 11am to 1pm. So, she was waiting there during that time.

Emily saw Elizabeth working out at the gym from 1pm to 2pm. So, she was at the gym from 1pm to 2pm.

Now, the bakery was closed after 7pm. That means Elizabeth couldn't have gone to the bakery after 7pm because it was already closed.

Putting this all together:

- **5am to 6am:** Jennifer saw her on the rooftop.
- **6am to 7am:** William saw her at school.
- **7am to 11am:** Thomas saw her at the yoga studio.
- **11am to 1pm:** Sarah saw her at the airport.
- **1pm to 2pm:** Emily saw her at the gym.

So, the times when Elizabeth wasn't seen by anyone else are:

- Between 2pm and 7pm: The bakery was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone after that.

But looking at the options:

- **(A) 11am to 1pm:** Sarah saw her at the airport during this time, so she wasn't at the bakery.
- **(B) 5am to 6am:** Jennifer saw her on the rooftop during this time.
- **(C) 2pm to 7pm:** The bakery was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone during this time.
- **(D) 7am to 11am:** Thomas saw her at the yoga studio during this time.

Wait, none of these options seem to fit. The only time she wasn't seen by anyone else is between 2pm and 7pm, but the bakery was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone.

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check:

- 5am to 6am: Rooftop
- 6am to 7am: School
- 7am to 11am: Yoga
- 11am to 1pm: Airport
- 1pm to 2pm: Gym
- After 7pm: Bakery closed

So, the only possible time she could have gone to the bakery is between 2pm and 7pm, but since the bakery was closed after 7pm, she couldn't have gone during that time either.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

The options are:

(A) 11am to 1pm
(B) 5am to 6am
(C) 2pm to 7pm
(D) 7am to 11am

But based on the information, none of these times are available because she was either seen by someone else or the bakery was closed.

Wait, maybe the bakery was closed after 7pm, so she could have gone before 7pm. But looking at the times:

- Between 2pm to 7pm, she was either at the gym (1pm-2pm) or not seen by anyone. But after 2pm, she wasn't doing anything else mentioned. So, maybe she could have gone between 2pm and 7pm.

But the options include (C) 2pm to 7pm. Even though the bakery was closed after 7pm, she could have gone before that.

So, the answer is (C).

Wait, but in the options, (C) is 2pm to 7pm. So, yes, that's the only possible time she could have gone.

So, the correct answer is (C).
</think>

The correct answer is (C) 2pm to 7pm.

**Answer:** (C)
