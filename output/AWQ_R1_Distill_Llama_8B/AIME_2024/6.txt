Alright, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem involving a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), and we need to find \(m + n\).

First, let me try to understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, which has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each color having a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is \(2^8 = 256\).

Now, the question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon which will map all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. In other words, after some rotation, every blue vertex is moved to a position that was red before the rotation.

Hmm. So, for a given coloring, we need to check if such a rotation exists. If it does, then we count that coloring towards our probability.

I think a good starting point is to consider the symmetries of the octagon. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by \(0^\circ, 45^\circ, 90^\circ, \ldots, 315^\circ\) and look the same. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices.

So, if we can find a rotation (i.e., a permutation of the vertices) that sends blue vertices to red vertices, that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but actually, more precisely, for each rotation, the set of blue vertices should be mapped to the set of red vertices. So, if \(B\) is the set of blue vertices, then after the rotation, each vertex in \(B\) should be moved to a vertex that was originally in the red set \(R\). Since the entire vertex set is partitioned into \(R\) and \(B\), this is equivalent to saying that the rotation maps \(B\) to \(R\), which is possible only if \(B\) is invariant under the rotation, but in a way that swaps its elements with \(R\).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutation cycles. For each rotation, the permutation of the vertices can be broken down into cycles. For the rotation to map \(B\) to \(R\), each cycle must contain an equal number of blue and red vertices, right? Because otherwise, you can't swap them.

But actually, no, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again.

Suppose we have a rotation that is a permutation \(p\) of the vertices. Then, for \(p\) to map \(B\) to \(R\), it must be that \(p(B) \subseteq R\). Since \(p\) is a permutation, it's a bijection, so \(p(B)\) is also a set of 4 vertices (since there are 8 vertices, half blue and half red). Wait, no, actually, the number of blue vertices can vary. Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, the coloring is arbitrary. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, so the number of blue vertices could be anything from 0 to 8. But in our case, we need the number of blue vertices to be equal to the number of red vertices, because the rotation must swap each blue vertex to a red one, and vice versa.

Wait, is that necessarily true? If you have a rotation that swaps blue to red, then the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, right? Because the rotation is a bijection, so it maps red to blue and blue to red. So, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, which is 4 each.

Therefore, the first thing is that for such a rotation to exist, the coloring must have exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. Because otherwise, the rotation can't swap equal numbers.

So, that already reduces our problem. We don't need to consider colorings with an odd number of blue vertices, because they can't be mapped to red vertices via rotation.

Therefore, the total number of colorings with exactly 4 blue vertices is \(\binom{8}{4} = 70\). So, the probability we're looking for is the number of such colorings where a rotation exists that swaps blue and red, divided by 70.

Wait, but actually, the probability is the number of such colorings where such a rotation exists, divided by the total number of colorings, which is 256. But since we're conditioning on having exactly 4 blue vertices, it's the number of such colorings divided by 70. But no, the problem doesn't specify that the number of blue vertices is 4. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, actually, let me re-examine the problem: "the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices."

So, regardless of the number of blue vertices. So, if there are k blue vertices, we need a rotation that maps each blue vertex to a red vertex. So, in that case, the rotation must be such that it maps each blue vertex to a unique red vertex, and since it's a permutation, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices.

Therefore, the number of blue vertices must equal 4, because the octagon has 8 vertices, so 4 blue and 4 red. Therefore, only colorings with exactly 4 blue vertices can satisfy the condition.

So, that simplifies things: the total number of such colorings is \(\binom{8}{4} = 70\). Now, among these 70 colorings, how many can be rotated so that blue vertices are mapped to red ones.

But now, for each such coloring, does there exist such a rotation? Or is it that for some colorings, such a rotation exists, and for others, it doesn't.

Wait, so perhaps not all colorings with 4 blue vertices can be rotated to swap blue and red. It depends on the arrangement of the blue vertices.

So, the key is to find the number of such colorings where the blue vertices form a single orbit under the action of the rotation group. Wait, no, actually, maybe the blue vertices need to be mapped to red vertices, so the rotation must act as a derangement on the blue vertices, sending each blue vertex to a red one.

But since the rotation is a permutation, this is equivalent to the blue vertices being a union of cycles whose lengths divide the order of the rotation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, so the rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. Each rotation can be identified with a permutation of the 8 vertices.

For a given coloring, a rotation that maps blue to red exists if and only if the permutation corresponding to the rotation is such that every cycle in the permutation contains exactly one blue and one red vertex.

Wait, that might not be the exact condition, but let's think.

Suppose we have a rotation by 45°, which is a single cycle of length 8. If we want this rotation to map blue vertices to red ones, then in this single cycle, every blue vertex must be mapped to a red vertex, and vice versa. But since it's a single cycle, this would require that the blue vertices are equally spaced such that each blue vertex is mapped to a unique red vertex, and vice versa.

Wait, but in a single cycle of length 8, the rotation by 45°, the permutation is a single 8-cycle. So, for the blue vertices to be mapped to red ones, the set of blue vertices must form a union of cycles under this permutation.

Wait, but the permutation is a single 8-cycle, so the blue vertices can only be mapped to red ones if the blue vertices are arranged such that each blue vertex is in a different position from a red vertex, but since it's a single cycle, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the orbit structure.

If a rotation is a permutation that is a single cycle of length 8, then for the blue vertices to be mapped to red ones, the blue set B must be mapped to R, which is equivalent to B being a union of cycles that are mapped to R.

But since the permutation is a single 8-cycle, the only way for B to be mapped to R is that B is a union of cycles whose lengths divide 8, but since it's a single cycle, the only way is that B is either empty or the entire set.

But in our case, B has 4 elements, so that's not possible. So, a single 8-cycle rotation cannot map 4 blue vertices to 4 red vertices unless the blue vertices are arranged in a way that they form a single orbit under the rotation, but since it's a single cycle, that would require the blue vertices to be every other vertex, but that would create a 4-cycle, which is not a single 8-cycle.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotation must act as a derangement on the blue vertices, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, another approach: For the octagon to be rotated so that all blue vertices go to red ones, it's equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a union of orbits under some rotation.

But each nontrivial rotation (i.e., rotations by 45°, 90°, etc.) partitions the octagon into cycles. For example, a rotation by 90° partitions the octagon into two cycles of length 4 each.

Similarly, a rotation by 45° is a single cycle of length 8.

Therefore, for a given coloring with 4 blue vertices, we need to check whether the blue vertices can be covered by the cycles of some rotation.

Wait, but in order for a rotation to map all blue vertices to red ones, the blue vertices must lie in the cycles that the rotation moves to red vertices.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Maybe let's think in terms of group actions. The rotation group of the octagon is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_8\), the integers modulo 8 under addition. Each rotation can be represented by an element of \(\mathbb{Z}_8\), which is the shift amount.

So, for each rotation by \(k \times 45^\circ\), we can model the permutation as adding \(k\) modulo 8 to each vertex's position.

Then, for a given coloring (i.e., a subset \(B\) of the vertices), we want to find if there exists a \(k \in \mathbb{Z}_8\) such that \(B + k \subseteq R\), where \(R\) is the set of red vertices.

Since \(R = V \setminus B\), this is equivalent to \(B + k \subseteq V \setminus B\), which can be rewritten as \(B + k \subseteq V \setminus B\), which is equivalent to \(B + k \cap B = \emptyset\), meaning that \(B\) and \(B + k\) are disjoint.

But since \(B\) and \(B + k\) are both subsets of size 4, their intersection is empty only if \(B\) is a union of two disjoint orbits under the rotation by \(k\).

Wait, so for some \(k\), the set \(B\) must be a union of entire orbits under the rotation by \(k\). Because if \(B\) is a union of entire orbits, then adding \(k\) will permute the vertices within each orbit, so \(B + k\) will be the same as \(B\), which is not helpful.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, if \(B\) is a union of entire orbits under a rotation \(k\), then \(B + k\) is equal to \(B\), so \(B + k \subseteq B\), which would mean that \(B\) is a union of orbits, but we need \(B + k \subseteq R\), so \(B + k\) must be a subset of \(V \setminus B\). Therefore, \(B\) must be a union of orbits, and \(B + k\) is another union of orbits, which are the same as \(B\), but then \(B + k\) would not be a subset of \(R\).

Wait, maybe I need a different approach.

Perhaps considering that for a rotation by \(k\), the permutation decomposes into cycles. For \(B\) to be mapped to \(R\), each cycle in the permutation must contain exactly one blue and one red vertex.

Therefore, each cycle in the cycle decomposition of the permutation corresponding to rotation \(k\) must have an equal number of blue and red vertices.

But since each cycle must contain an equal number of blue and red, the length of each cycle must be even, right?

But the cycle length can be 2, 4, 8, etc., but in our case, the total number of vertices is 8, so the possible cycle types for the permutation are:

- A single 8-cycle (for rotation by 45°)
- Two cycles of length 4 (for rotation by 90°)
- Four cycles of length 2 (for rotation by 180°)
- Or combinations, but since we have 8 vertices, the possible cycle decompositions are:

1. 8-cycle (rotation by 45°)
2. 4-cycle and another 4-cycle (rotation by 90°)
3. 2-cycles and 2-cycles and 2-cycles and 2-cycles (rotation by 180°)
4. 4-cycle and four 2-cycles (rotation by 135°, but wait, rotation by 135° is equivalent to rotation by 3*45°, which is a 8-cycle? Wait, no, rotation by 135° is a 4-cycle? Wait, no, let me compute.

Wait, actually, rotation by 135° is 3 steps of 45°, so the permutation is a single 8-cycle because 3 and 8 are coprime. So, rotation by 135° is still a single 8-cycle.

Wait, similarly, rotation by 180° is a product of four transpositions (2-cycles), so that's four independent swaps.

Similarly, rotation by 270° is the same as rotation by 90°, just in the opposite direction.

Rotation by 0° is the identity permutation, which is eight 1-cycles.

So, for each rotation, the cycle structure is:

- 0°: eight 1-cycles
- 45°: one 8-cycle
- 90°: two 4-cycles
- 135°: one 8-cycle
- 180°: four 2-cycles
- 225°: one 8-cycle
- 270°: two 4-cycles
- 315°: one 8-cycle

So, for each rotation, the cycle structure is as above.

Now, for a given coloring with 4 blue and 4 red vertices, we want to know if there exists a rotation such that each cycle in the rotation's cycle decomposition has exactly half blue and half red vertices.

Wait, but since the blue vertices must be mapped to red vertices, each cycle must contain exactly half blue and half red. But since each cycle is a subset of the vertices, for a cycle of even length, say 2, 4, or 8, it can contain half blue and half red.

But for a cycle of odd length, which we don't have here because all cycle lengths are even (since 8 is even and we're breaking it into cycles of even lengths). So, in our case, all cycles have even lengths: 2, 4, or 8.

Wait, 8 is even, 4 is even, and 2 is even, so yes, all cycles have even length.

Therefore, for each cycle in the rotation's cycle decomposition, if the cycle length is even, it's possible to have half blue and half red.

Therefore, for a given coloring with 4 blue vertices, we need to see if it can be expressed as a union of cycles where each cycle has exactly half blue and half red.

Therefore, for each rotation, we can check whether the coloring can be covered by the cycles of that rotation, each contributing an even number of blue vertices.

But this is getting abstract. Maybe a better approach is to count the number of such colorings for each rotation and then use inclusion-exclusion.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to model this as a group action. The rotation group acts on the octagon, and we want to count the number of colorings where the orbit of each blue vertex under some group element is entirely contained in the red set.

Wait, but actually, more precisely, for the coloring to be such that there exists a group element \(g\) where \(g(B) \subseteq R\), which would imply that \(g(B) \subseteq V \setminus B\), so \(B \subseteq g^{-1}(V \setminus B)\).

Hmm, this is getting a bit too abstract.

Wait, another idea: For a given coloring, the rotation exists if and only if the coloring is a derangement with respect to some rotation, but I don't think that's exactly right.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this problem as a question about derangements where the permutation induced by the rotation maps blue to red.

Wait, but the key is that such a permutation exists if and only if the blue vertices form a single orbit under the rotation. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the possible rotations and count the number of colorings where the blue vertices are fixed by some rotation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the total number of such colorings.

Since the rotation group has 8 elements (rotations by 0°, 45°, ..., 315°), each corresponding to a permutation of the vertices.

For each rotation \(g\), the number of colorings where \(g(B) \subseteq R\) is equal to the number of colorings where \(B\) is a subset of \(g^{-1}(R)\). But since \(g\) is a permutation, \(g^{-1}(R)\) is just another subset of the vertices, specifically, the preimage of \(R\) under \(g\).

But since \(R = V \setminus B\), \(g^{-1}(R) = V \setminus g^{-1}(B)\). So, \(B \subseteq V \setminus g^{-1}(B)\), which is equivalent to \(B \cap g^{-1}(B) = \emptyset\). So, \(B\) and \(g^{-1}(B)\) are disjoint.

Therefore, the number of such colorings for a given \(g\) is equal to the number of subsets \(B\) of size 4 such that \(B \cap g^{-1}(B) = \emptyset\).

But for each \(g\), the number of such subsets \(B\) is equal to the number of subsets \(B\) of size 4 where \(B\) and \(g^{-1}(B)\) are disjoint.

But note that \(g^{-1}(B)\) is another subset of size 4, since \(B\) has size 4, and \(g\) is a permutation (so it's a bijection), so \(g^{-1}(B)\) also has size 4.

Therefore, the condition \(B \cap g^{-1}(B) = \emptyset\) implies that \(B\) and \(g^{-1}(B)\) are disjoint subsets each of size 4 in an 8-element set. So, \(B\) and \(g^{-1}(B)\) form a partition of the 8 vertices into two sets of 4.

Therefore, for each \(g\), the number of such subsets \(B\) is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 vertices into two sets of 4, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \binom{8}{4}\) because choosing \(B\) automatically determines \(g^{-1}(B)\), but since we're counting unordered pairs, we divide by 2. So, the number is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35\).

But wait, no, because for each \(g\), \(g^{-1}\) is a specific permutation, so \(g^{-1}(B)\) is just another specific subset. So, perhaps the number is equal to the number of such subsets \(B\) where \(B\) is entirely contained in a single orbit under \(g\).

Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.

If \(g\) is a rotation, then its cycle structure determines how \(g\) acts on the vertices.

For example, if \(g\) is a single 8-cycle (rotations by 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°), then the entire set of vertices is a single orbit. Therefore, \(g^{-1}(B)\) is just another 4-element subset. So, the condition \(B \cap g^{-1}(B) = \emptyset\) is equivalent to \(B\) being a self-complementary set with respect to \(g\).

But since \(g\) is a single cycle, we can think of this condition as \(B\) being a set such that when you rotate it by \(g\), it maps to another set disjoint from itself.

But in the case of a single 8-cycle, any subset \(B\) will be mapped to \(g(B)\), which is another subset of size 4. So, for \(B\) and \(g(B)\) to be disjoint, \(B\) must be a union of an independent set in the cycle.

Wait, maybe another way: If \(g\) is an 8-cycle, then the action is cyclic, so the subsets \(B\) can be considered as binary vectors of length 8. The condition \(B \cap g(B) = \emptyset\) is equivalent to \(B\) being a set such that its cyclic shift is disjoint from it.

This is similar to a concept in coding theory where codes have certain auto-correlation properties.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, for an 8-cycle, the number of subsets \(B\) of size 4 such that \(B\) and \(g(B)\) are disjoint is equal to the number of 4-element subsets where no two elements are adjacent in the cycle.

Wait, that's similar to counting the number of independent sets of size 4 in an 8-cycle graph where adjacency is defined by the rotation.

Wait, no, actually, if you think of the 8-cycle as a graph, with edges connecting each vertex to its next neighbor, then the condition \(B \cap g(B) = \emptyset\) is equivalent to \(B\) having no edges between consecutive vertices, but actually, no, because \(g(B)\) is a shift, not the next neighbor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where edges connect each vertex to its image under \(g\). But in that case, the graph would consist of a single 8-cycle, since \(g\) is an 8-cycle.

Therefore, in this graph, the condition \(B \cap g(B) = \emptyset\) is equivalent to \(B\) being an independent set in this graph. But wait, in the graph where each vertex is connected to its image under \(g\), which is a single 8-cycle, the independent sets in this graph are sets of vertices with no two consecutive in the cycle.

But wait, our condition is different: we need \(B\) and \(g(B)\) to be disjoint, which is a stronger condition.

Wait, if \(B\) is an independent set in the graph defined by the rotation \(g\), which is an 8-cycle, then \(B\) has no two consecutive vertices. But \(g(B)\) is the set shifted by one, so \(g(B)\) is the set of next vertices. So, for \(B\) and \(g(B)\) to be disjoint, \(B\) must be an independent set in the 8-cycle, and also, \(g(B)\) must not intersect with \(B\), which would happen if \(B\) is an independent set.

Wait, actually, in the 8-cycle, an independent set is a set of vertices with no two adjacent. Then, \(g(B)\) is the set of next vertices, which are adjacent to \(B\). So, if \(B\) is an independent set, then \(g(B)\) is a set of vertices adjacent to \(B\), which are not in \(B\), so \(B\) and \(g(B)\) are disjoint.

Therefore, the number of such subsets \(B\) is equal to the number of independent sets of size 4 in the 8-cycle graph.

Wait, but an independent set in an 8-cycle graph can be of various sizes. The number of independent sets of size 4 is not straightforward.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the number of 4-element independent sets in an 8-cycle.

But how?

The number of independent sets of size \(k\) in an \(n\)-cycle is a known combinatorial problem, but the exact count can be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model this as a recurrence relation.

Let me recall that the number of independent sets on a path graph can be computed using linear recurrences, and for a cycle, it's similar but with the condition that the first and last vertices are also not adjacent.

So, for an 8-cycle, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) can be computed using inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or combinatorial arguments.

Wait, let's try to count them.

In an 8-cycle, label the vertices \(0, 1, 2, ..., 7\), arranged in a circle.

An independent set is a set of vertices with no two consecutive.

So, to count the number of independent sets of size 4, we can fix one vertex and count the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 vertices such that none are adjacent to each other or to the fixed vertex.

But due to circular symmetry, fixing one vertex doesn't change the count.

Wait, actually, in a cycle, fixing one vertex breaks the circular symmetry, so it's a standard technique to compute independent sets on cycles.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the number of independent sets on a cycle graph \(C_n\):

The number of independent sets on \(C_n\) is equal to \(F_{n+1} + F_{n-1}\), where \(F_n\) is the nth Fibonacci number. But that's for all independent sets, regardless of size. We need the number of independent sets of size exactly 4.

Hmm, perhaps not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

The total number of subsets of size 4 is \(\binom{8}{4} = 70\).

From this, we subtract the number of subsets that have at least one pair of consecutive vertices.

But in a cycle, the count is a bit more involved because of the circular nature.

Wait, so for a linear chain (path graph), the number of subsets of size \(k\) with no two consecutive vertices can be computed using \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k}\), but for a cycle, it's different.

Wait, actually, for a cycle, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) is equal to the number for the path graph minus the number where the first and last vertices are both included, which would create a conflict.

Wait, more precisely, using the formula:

Number of independent sets on cycle \(C_n\) of size \(k\) is equal to the number of independent sets on path \(P_n\) of size \(k\) minus the number of independent sets on path \(P_{n-2}\) of size \(k - 2\).

Wait, maybe not exactly, but let me recall the formula.

In general, for a cycle graph \(C_n\), the number of independent sets of size \(k\) is equal to the number for the path graph \(P_n\) minus the number where both the first and last vertices are included, which would create a conflict.

Therefore, using the formula:

\(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\)

Where \(IS_C(n, k)\) is the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on cycle \(C_n\), and \(IS_P(n, k)\) is the number on path \(P_n\).

For path graphs, \(IS_P(n, k)\) is equal to \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k}\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, for path graphs, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) is equal to the number of ways to place \(k\) non-overlapping dominos on the path, but it's actually given by \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k}\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Actually, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a path graph is equal to \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k}\). Let me check for small \(n\).

For example, for \(n = 3\), path graph \(P_3\), the number of independent sets of size 1 is 3, size 2 is 1, and size 3 is 0 (since no three non-consecutive vertices in a path of 3).

Wait, but \(\binom{3 - 1 + 1}{1} = \binom{3}{1} = 3\), which is correct for size 1.

For size 2, \(\binom{3 - 2 + 1}{2} = \binom{2}{2} = 1\), which is correct.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Similarly, for \(n = 4\), \(P_4\):

Number of independent sets of size 1: 4

Size 2: 3

Size 3: 2

Size 4: 0

Wait, but according to the formula, size 1: \(\binom{4 - 1 + 1}{1} = \binom{4}{1} = 4\), correct.

Size 2: \(\binom{4 - 2 + 1}{2} = \binom{3}{2} = 3\), correct.

Size 3: \(\binom{4 - 3 + 1}{3} = \binom{2}{3} = 0\), but actually, there are independent sets of size 3 in \(P_4\): {1,3}, {2,4}, but wait, no, in \(P_4\), you can't have 3 non-consecutive vertices because with 4 vertices, any 3 vertices must include at least two adjacent ones. Wait, no, actually, in \(P_4\), the independent sets of size 3 would be {1,3}, {2,4}, but wait, that's only size 2.

Wait, no, in \(P_4\), the maximum independent set is size 2, because if you pick vertex 1, you can't pick 2, but you can pick 3 or 4. Similarly, if you pick 2, you can't pick 3, but can pick 4. Wait, so actually, the maximum independent set in \(P_4\) is size 2, so the number of independent sets of size 3 is zero.

Wait, so the formula gives \(\binom{4 - 3 + 1}{3} = \binom{2}{3} = 0\), which is correct.

So, in general, the formula \(IS_P(n, k) = \binom{n - k + 1}{k}\) holds for the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a path graph with \(n\) vertices.

Therefore, for cycle graphs, the formula is \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

Wait, let me verify with \(n = 4\), \(k = 2\):

\(IS_C(4, 2) = IS_P(4, 2) - IS_P(2, 0)\).

Wait, \(IS_P(4, 2) = \binom{4 - 2 + 1}{2} = \binom{3}{2} = 3\).

\(IS_P(2, 0) = 1\) (the empty set).

So, \(IS_C(4, 2) = 3 - 1 = 2\).

But in \(C_4\), the number of independent sets of size 2 is indeed 2: {1,3}, {2,4}.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for \(n = 5\), \(k = 2\):

\(IS_C(5, 2) = IS_P(5, 2) - IS_P(3, 0)\).

\(IS_P(5, 2) = \binom{5 - 2 + 1}{2} = \binom{4}{2} = 6\).

\(IS_P(3, 0) = 1\).

So, \(IS_C(5, 2) = 6 - 1 = 5\).

Wait, but in \(C_5\), the independent sets of size 2 are:

Each vertex can be paired with two non-adjacent vertices, but due to the cycle, each edge is part of two different pairs.

Wait, actually, in \(C_5\), the number of independent sets of size 2 is 5. Each single vertex has two non-adjacent vertices, but since the cycle is symmetric, the total is indeed 5.

Yes, that works.

So, generalizing, for a cycle \(C_n\), the number of independent sets of size \(k\) is:

\(IS_C(n, k) = \binom{n - k + 1}{k} - \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 2}\)

Wait, because \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

But \(IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\) is equal to \(\binom{(n - 2) - (k - 2) + 1}{k - 2}\) = \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k - 2}\).

Wait, no, hold on. \(IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\) is equal to \(\binom{(n - 2) - (k - 2) + 1}{k - 2}\) = \(\binom{n - k + 1}{k - 2}\).

But in our formula, it's \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

Wait, but according to our earlier example, when \(n=4\), \(k=2\), we had \(IS_C(4,2) = 3 - 1 = 2\), which is equal to \(IS_P(4,2) - IS_P(2,0) = 3 - 1 = 2\). So, in this case, \(n - 2 = 2\), \(k - 2 = 0\), and \(IS_P(2, 0) = 1\).

So, generalizing, \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

Therefore, the formula is:

\(IS_C(n, k) = \binom{n - k + 1}{k} - \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 2}\).

But we need to be careful when \(k - 2\) is negative or when \(n - k - 1\) is less than \(k - 2\), in which case the binomial coefficient is zero.

So, applying this formula to our problem, where \(n = 8\) and \(k = 4\):

\(IS_C(8, 4) = \binom{8 - 4 + 1}{4} - \binom{8 - 4 - 1}{4 - 2}\).

Calculating:

First term: \(\binom{5}{4} = 5\).

Second term: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).

Therefore, \(IS_C(8, 4) = 5 - 3 = 2\).

Wait, that can't be right because I think the number of independent sets of size 4 in an 8-cycle is more than 2.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in an 8-cycle, the independent sets of size 4 are sets of 4 vertices with no two adjacent.

But in an 8-cycle, the number of such sets is actually 2: the two sets where the vertices are every other vertex, either starting at 0 or starting at 1. So, {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

Wait, but in reality, there are more than 2 independent sets of size 4 in an 8-cycle.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, let me actually count them.

In an 8-cycle, how many independent sets of size 4 are there?

An independent set is a set of 4 vertices with no two adjacent.

In an 8-cycle, each vertex is connected to its two neighbors.

To choose 4 non-adjacent vertices, we can model this as placing 4 objects on 8 positions with no two adjacent.

This is similar to placing 4 non-overlapping objects on a circle of 8 positions.

The number of ways is equal to \(\binom{8 - 4}{4}\) for a circle, but I might be misremembering.

Wait, actually, the number of ways to choose \(k\) non-consecutive objects on a circle of \(n\) objects is given by:

\(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the formula for the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a cycle \(C_n\) is:

\(\frac{n}{n} \times \binom{n - k}{k}\).

Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the number of ways to place \(k\) non-attacking kings on a circular chessboard of \(n\) squares.

Wait, kings attack adjacent squares, so placing non-attacking kings is similar to placing independent sets on a graph.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, let's model it as placing 4 objects on 8 positions arranged in a circle, with no two adjacent.

This is equivalent to placing 4 objects with at least one empty spot between them.

The standard formula for the number of ways to place \(k\) non-adjacent objects on a circle of \(n\) positions is:

\(\frac{n}{n} \times \binom{n - k}{k}\).

Wait, no, perhaps another way.

Imagine breaking the circle by fixing one vertex as not chosen, then it becomes a linear problem.

So, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a circle \(C_n\) is equal to the number on a path \(P_n\) minus the number where the first and last vertices are both chosen.

Wait, so using inclusion-exclusion, \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

Wait, that's similar to what I thought earlier.

So, for \(n = 8\), \(k = 4\):

\(IS_C(8, 4) = IS_P(8, 4) - IS_P(6, 2)\).

Compute \(IS_P(8, 4)\):

Using the path formula, \(IS_P(n, k) = \binom{n - k + 1}{k}\).

So, \(IS_P(8, 4) = \binom{8 - 4 + 1}{4} = \binom{5}{4} = 5\).

Then, \(IS_P(6, 2) = \binom{6 - 2 + 1}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10\).

Therefore, \(IS_C(8, 4) = 5 - 10 = -5\). Wait, that can't be, since the number of independent sets can't be negative.

Wait, that suggests that the formula isn't directly applicable here, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\), but when \(n - 2 < k - 2\), we need to adjust.

Wait, but in our case, \(n = 8\), \(k = 4\), so \(n - 2 = 6\), \(k - 2 = 2\). So, \(IS_P(6, 2) = 10\), which is correct.

But \(IS_C(8, 4)\) can't be negative, so maybe the formula isn't \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\), but rather something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - \binom{n - 2}{k - 2}\).

But in the case of \(n = 4\), \(k = 2\):

\(IS_C(4, 2) = IS_P(4, 2) - \binom{2}{0} = 3 - 1 = 2\), which is correct.

Similarly, for \(n = 5\), \(k = 2\):

\(IS_C(5, 2) = IS_P(5, 2) - \binom{3}{0} = 6 - 1 = 5\), which is correct.

Wait, so in general, is the formula \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - \binom{n - 2}{k - 2}\)?

Wait, that seems to work for the examples above.

So, for \(n = 8\), \(k = 4\):

\(IS_C(8, 4) = IS_P(8, 4) - \binom{6}{2}\).

Compute:

\(IS_P(8, 4) = \binom{8 - 4 + 1}{4} = \binom{5}{4} = 5\).

\(\binom{6}{2} = 15\).

Therefore, \(IS_C(8, 4) = 5 - 15 = -10\), which is still negative, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps this formula is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different formula.

Wait, let me refer back to the problem.

We have an 8-cycle, and we want to count the number of independent sets of size 4.

An independent set is a set of 4 vertices with no two adjacent.

In an 8-cycle, each vertex has two neighbors.

So, how can we count the number of such sets?

We can model this as placing 4 non-adjacent vertices on an 8-cycle.

This is equivalent to placing 4 vertices such that no two are next to each other.

This can be thought of as arranging 4 objects with at least one space between them on a circle of 8 positions.

Wait, the formula for the number of ways to place \(k\) non-adjacent objects on a circle of \(n\) positions is:

\(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

Wait, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to fix one vertex as not chosen, breaking the circle into a line.

So, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a cycle is equal to the number on a path minus the number where both the first and last vertices are chosen.

Wait, as we tried earlier.

So, using this, the number is \(IS_C(n, k) = IS_P(n, k) - IS_P(n - 2, k - 2)\).

But when we tried with \(n=8\), \(k=4\), we get negative numbers, which suggests that the formula is not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approach.

Wait, in an 8-cycle, to choose 4 non-adjacent vertices, we can think of it as choosing 4 vertices such that between any two chosen vertices, there is at least one unchosen vertex.

This is similar to placing 4 objects on 8 positions arranged in a circle, with no two objects adjacent.

This is a standard combinatorial problem.

The number of ways to arrange \(k\) non-adjacent objects on a circle of \(n\) positions is given by:

\(\frac{n}{n} \times \binom{n - k}{k}\).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the formula is:

\(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

Wait, testing this with \(n=4\), \(k=2\):

\(\binom{2}{2} + \binom{1}{1} = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is correct.

For \(n=5\), \(k=2\):

\(\binom{3}{2} + \binom{2}{1} = 3 + 2 = 5\), which is correct.

For \(n=8\), \(k=4\):

\(\binom{4}{4} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 = 2\), but that's not correct because in an 8-cycle, there are more than 2 independent sets of size 4.

Wait, no, actually, in an 8-cycle, the number of independent sets of size 4 is 2.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, if we fix one vertex, say vertex 0, then the remaining 3 vertices must be chosen from vertices 2, 4, 6, but wait, no, because in a cycle, choosing vertex 0 forbids choosing 1 and 7.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Wait, maybe the number of independent sets of size 4 in an 8-cycle is indeed 2: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

But wait, actually, you can also have other independent sets.

For example, {0,2,4,7} is an independent set because 7 is not adjacent to 0, 2, or 4.

Wait, 7 is adjacent to 6 and 0, but in this case, 7 is not adjacent to 0,2,4.

Wait, but 0 is adjacent to 7, so if we have vertex 0 in the set, we can't have vertex 7.

Wait, so {0,2,4,7} is not an independent set because 0 and 7 are adjacent.

Therefore, that's invalid.

Wait, actually, no, if you have vertex 0, you cannot have 1 or 7.

Therefore, any independent set containing 0 cannot contain 1 or 7.

So, if you have vertex 0, then the remaining 3 vertices must be chosen from 2,3,4,5,6.

But with the condition that no two are adjacent.

Wait, but in a cycle, 2 is adjacent to 3, 3 is adjacent to 4, etc.

Wait, so, for example, choosing 2,4,6 would be allowed, since none are adjacent.

Similarly, choosing 2,4,5 would not be allowed because 4 and 5 are adjacent.

Wait, but 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of independent sets of size 4 in an 8-cycle is 2.

Wait, no, I think it's more than 2.

Wait, perhaps 8 choose 4 is 70, but we need to subtract the number of sets with adjacent vertices.

But it's complicated on a cycle.

Wait, maybe it's better to look up the formula.

Wait, according to some references, the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on a cycle graph \(C_n\) is equal to \(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

So, for \(n = 8\), \(k = 4\):

\(\binom{4}{4} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 = 2\).

But as we saw, that's not correct because there are more independent sets.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another formula: The number of independent sets on a cycle \(C_n\) is \(F_{n + 1} + F_{n - 1}\), where \(F_n\) is the Fibonacci sequence.

But that counts all independent sets, not of a specific size.

Wait, maybe for each \(k\), the number is \(F_{n - k} + F_{n - k - 2}\).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Total number of subsets of size 4: 70.

Subtract the number of subsets with at least one pair of adjacent vertices.

In a cycle, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of ways to choose 4 vertices with at least one adjacent pair.

But on a cycle, it's tricky because of the circular overlap.

Alternatively, use the formula for the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from \(n\) arranged in a circle with no two adjacent:

It is given by:

\(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

Wait, but that formula gives 2 for \(n=8\), \(k=4\), which seems low.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Number of independent sets on a cycle \(C_n\) of size \(k\) is equal to \(\frac{n}{n} \times \binom{n - k}{k}\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to use generating functions.

The generating function for independent sets on a cycle graph is \((1 + x)^n + (1 + x)^{n - 2}\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, the generating function is \((1 + x)^n - x^n\), but that's for something else.

Wait, actually, the generating function for independent sets on a cycle graph \(C_n\) is the same as for a path graph \(P_n\) minus the generating function for the two-vertex path, which is \(x^2\).

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for a recurrence relation.

Let me define \(a_n\) as the number of independent sets on a cycle \(C_n\), and \(b_n\) as the number on a path \(P_n\).

We know that \(a_n = b_n - a_{n - 2}\), because we subtract the cases where both the first and last vertices are included, which would create a conflict in the cycle.

But for our case, we need \(a_n(k)\), the number of independent sets of size \(k\) on \(C_n\).

Wait, but I don't know the recurrence for the number of independent sets of a specific size.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use exponential generating functions or something.

But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a necklace problem.

If we have an 8-bead necklace, and we want to count the number of necklaces where 4 beads are chosen with no two adjacent.

But in a circular necklace, the count is different from a linear one.

Wait, but in combinatorics, the number of ways to choose \(k\) non-consecutive beads on a circle of \(n\) beads is:

\(\frac{n}{n} \times \binom{n - k}{k}\).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the formula is:

Number of ways = \(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

Wait, for \(n=8\), \(k=4\):

= \(\binom{4}{4} + \binom{3}{3}\) = 1 + 1 = 2.

But as before, in reality, there are more than 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Number of independent sets on a cycle \(C_n\) of size \(k\) is equal to \(\binom{n - k}{k} + \binom{n - k - 1}{k - 1}\).

But for \(n=8\), \(k=4\):

= \(\binom{4}{4} + \binom{3}{3}\) = 1 + 1 = 2.

But in reality, as we saw, you can have independent sets like {0,2,4,6}, {0,2,4,7}, but wait, no, {0,2,4,7} is invalid because 0 and 7 are adjacent.

Wait, no, in an 8-cycle, vertex 0 is adjacent to 1 and 7.

Therefore, if you include 0, you cannot include 1 or 7.

So, if you include 0, the remaining 3 vertices must be chosen from 2,3,4,5,6.

But with the condition that none are adjacent.

So, choosing 3 non-adjacent vertices from 5 in a line.

Wait, but 2,3,4,5,6 is a path of 5 vertices.

So, the number of independent sets of size 3 on a path of 5 is \(\binom{5 - 3 + 1}{3} = \binom{3}{3} = 1\).

Wait, but that can't be right because on a path of 5, you can have more than 1 independent set of size 3.

Wait, no, wait, for a path of 5, the number of independent sets of size 3 is \(\binom{5 - 3 + 1}{3} = 1\), which is correct because the only independent set of size 3 is {1,3,5} or something, but actually, no.

Wait, in a path of 5, the independent sets of size 3 are:

1. {1,3,5}

2. {2,4}

Wait, no, that's size 2.

Wait, actually, in a path of 5, the maximum independent set is size 3: {1,3,5}.

Wait, but is that the only one?

No, for example, {1,3,4} is not independent because 3 and 4 are adjacent.

Similarly, {1,4,5} is not independent because 4 and 5 are adjacent.

Wait, actually, no, in a path of 5, the only independent set of size 3 is {1,3,5}.

Because if you pick 1, you can't pick 2, but you can pick 3 and 5, which are not adjacent.

Similarly, if you pick 2, you can't pick 1 or 3, but then you can pick 4 or 5, but you can only pick one more, so maximum size is 2.

Wait, so in a path of 5, the only independent set of size 3 is {1,3,5}.

Therefore, the number is 1.

Therefore, going back, in the cycle, the number of independent sets containing 0 is 1.

Similarly, the number containing 1 is 1, and so on.

Therefore, total number of independent sets of size 4 in the cycle is 8 (each vertex can be the starting point of an independent set) times 1 (each gives one independent set) divided by something.

Wait, no, because each independent set is counted multiple times.

Wait, for example, the independent set {0,2,4,6} is counted once when starting at 0, and not when starting at others.

Wait, no, actually, each independent set is counted once for each vertex it contains.

Since each independent set of size 4 contains 4 vertices, each will be counted 4 times in the total.

Therefore, total number of independent sets is (8 * 1) / 4 = 2.

Wait, so that suggests that the total number is indeed 2.

But that contradicts my intuition.

Wait, but in reality, is that the case?

If we have an 8-cycle, the only independent sets of size 4 are the two sets where the vertices are every other vertex, either {0,2,4,6} or {1,3,5,7}.

Because any other set would have two vertices adjacent.

Wait, for example, {0,2,4,7} would have 0 adjacent to 7, so that's invalid.

Similarly, {0,2,5,7} has 5 adjacent to 7, which is invalid.

Wait, so actually, the only independent sets of size 4 are the two sets where the vertices are equally spaced.

Therefore, the number is indeed 2.

So, the formula was correct.

Therefore, \(IS_C(8, 4) = 2\).

So, going back, for each rotation by 45°, which is a single 8-cycle, the number of colorings where \(B\) and \(g(B)\) are disjoint is equal to 2.

Therefore, for each such \(g\), there are 2 colorings where \(B\) is an independent set, hence \(g(B)\) is disjoint.

But since the rotation group has 8 elements, but rotations by 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315° are all single 8-cycles, each contributing 2 colorings.

Wait, no, actually, for each such rotation, the number of colorings is 2.

But we have 4 such rotations (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°).

Therefore, total number of colorings where \(B\) is an independent set for some single 8-cycle rotation is 4 * 2 = 8.

But wait, but some colorings might satisfy the condition for multiple rotations.

For example, a coloring where all blue vertices are equally spaced (the two colorings we found) would satisfy the condition for all four single 8-cycle rotations.

But in reality, those two colorings are the same under rotation, so actually, each of those two colorings would satisfy the condition for all four single 8-cycle rotations.

Therefore, we have to be careful not to overcount.

Wait, let's think.

Each independent set corresponds to two colorings (the two equally spaced sets), and each such coloring is counted four times (once for each single 8-cycle rotation).

Therefore, the total number of colorings where \(B\) is an independent set for some single 8-cycle rotation is 2 colorings, each counted four times, so total 8, but since each coloring is unique, we have 2 colorings.

Wait, no, actually, each independent set is fixed by all single 8-cycle rotations, so each of the two colorings is counted four times in the total count.

Therefore, the actual number of unique colorings is 2.

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each independent set is a specific set of blue vertices, so each is unique.

Wait, perhaps the total number of such colorings is 2, each of which can be rotated by any of the four single 8-cycle rotations.

But no, each independent set is fixed by all single 8-cycle rotations, so each coloring satisfies the condition for all four rotations.

But regardless, for each coloring, it can be counted multiple times.

Wait, maybe we need to use inclusion-exclusion.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the total number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that \(B\) is mapped to \(R\).

We established that such colorings must have exactly 4 blue vertices.

Therefore, the total number is the number of such colorings.

But each such coloring is a 4-element subset \(B\) such that \(B\) is a union of cycles under some rotation.

Therefore, for each rotation, the number of such subsets is 2 (from the independent sets).

But the rotations can overlap in their colorings.

Therefore, the total number is equal to the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation.

But this is similar to counting colorings with a certain symmetry.

Wait, in Burnside's lemma, the number of colorings fixed by a group action is equal to the average number of fixed points.

But we need the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element.

Which is similar to the union of fixed colorings over all group elements.

By inclusion-exclusion, the total number is equal to the sum over group elements of fixed colorings minus the sum over pairs of group elements of fixed colorings, etc.

But this is going to be complicated.

But perhaps, given the small size of the group (order 8), it's manageable.

But maybe it's better to note that each such coloring is fixed by at least one rotation, so each such coloring is a derangement with respect to some rotation.

Wait, but actually, the number of colorings fixed by a rotation is equal to the number of colorings where the rotation acts as a permutation on the colors.

But since each color is red or blue, the number of colorings fixed by a rotation is equal to \(2^{\text{number of orbits under the rotation}}\).

Because for each orbit, the coloring must be constant on that orbit.

Therefore, for a rotation which decomposes the octagon into \(d\) orbits, the number of fixed colorings is \(2^d\).

So, for example, for the identity rotation (0°), which has 8 orbits (each vertex is its own orbit), the number of fixed colorings is \(2^8 = 256\).

For a rotation by 90°, which has two orbits of 4 vertices each, the number of fixed colorings is \(2^2 = 4\).

Similarly, for a rotation by 180°, which has four orbits of 2 vertices each, the number of fixed colorings is \(2^4 = 16\).

For a rotation by 45°, which has one orbit of 8, the number of fixed colorings is \(2^1 = 2\).

Similarly, for rotations by 135°, 225°, 315°, each have one orbit of 8, so fixed colorings are 2 each.

Therefore, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation is equal to the sum over each group element of fixed colorings minus the overlaps.

But using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (Fixed by identity) + (Fixed by 90° rotations) + (Fixed by 180° rotations) + (Fixed by 45° rotations) - overlaps.

But this is going to be complicated.

But actually, we need the number of colorings with exactly 4 blue vertices and fixed by some rotation.

Wait, but actually, the problem is not about colorings fixed by a rotation, but colorings for which there exists a rotation that maps blue vertices to red ones.

Which is equivalent to the blue set being mapped to red set, which is equivalent to the blue set being a union of orbits under some rotation.

But each orbit under a rotation is either a single 8-cycle or two 4-cycles or four 2-cycles.

Therefore, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, the blue set must be a union of some orbits under a rotation.

Since we need the blue set to be a union of orbits, and the total size is 4, the blue set can be either:

- A single orbit of size 4 under a 4-cycle rotation.

- Or two orbits of size 2 under a 2-cycle rotation.

Wait, but in an 8-cycle, the 4-cycle rotation decomposes the octagon into two 4-cycles.

Therefore, each orbit under a 4-cycle rotation is a 4-cycle.

Therefore, the blue set can be either:

- One orbit (a 4-cycle) under a 4-cycle rotation, or

- Two orbits (each a 2-cycle) under a 2-cycle rotation.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a 4-cycle under a 4-cycle rotation, plus the number where the blue set is two 2-cycles under a 2-cycle rotation.

First, let's compute the number of colorings where blue set is a 4-cycle under a 4-cycle rotation.

Each 4-cycle orbit under a 4-cycle rotation is a set of 4 consecutive vertices.

In the octagon, a 4-cycle rotation (90°) has two orbits, each consisting of 4 consecutive vertices.

Therefore, the number of such orbits is 8 (since the octagon has 8 vertices, each set of 4 consecutive vertices is an orbit under 90° rotation).

Wait, no, actually, under a 90° rotation, each orbit is a set of 4 vertices spaced 2 apart.

Wait, no, a 90° rotation on an octagon is a rotation by 4 positions, so it cycles vertices in cycles of length 4.

Wait, the orbits under a 90° rotation are two cycles of 4 vertices each, each consisting of vertices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 1, 3, 5, 7.

Therefore, each orbit under a 90° rotation is a set of 4 vertices every other vertex.

Therefore, the number of such orbits is 2.

Therefore, the number of colorings where the blue set is exactly one of these two orbits is 2.

Similarly, for a 180° rotation, which decomposes the octagon into four 2-cycles.

Each 2-cycle is a pair of opposite vertices.

Therefore, the orbits under a 180° rotation are four pairs: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

Therefore, the number of such orbits is 4.

Therefore, the number of colorings where the blue set is exactly one of these orbits is 4.

Therefore, the total number of colorings where the blue set is an orbit under some rotation is 2 (from 90° rotations) + 4 (from 180° rotations) = 6.

But wait, let's verify.

For 90° rotation, the two orbits are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}, so each of these can be colored blue, giving 2 colorings.

For 180° rotation, the four orbits are {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, each of which can be colored blue, giving 4 colorings.

But note that the coloring where all four pairs are colored blue is not allowed because we have exactly 4 blue vertices. Wait, no, wait, each orbit under 180° rotation is a pair, so to get 4 blue vertices, we need to choose two such pairs.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake.

If the blue set must be a union of orbits under some rotation, then for 90° rotation, the blue set must be either {0,2,4,6} or {1,3,5,7}, which are the two orbits.

For 180° rotation, the blue set can be any union of orbits, but since each orbit is size 2, and we need 4 blue vertices, we need to choose two orbits.

Therefore, the number of colorings where the blue set is a union of two 2-cycles under 180° rotation is equal to \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).

Wait, but each orbit is a pair, so choosing two orbits gives us a set of 4 blue vertices.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).

Therefore, for the 180° rotation, the number of colorings where the blue set is a union of two orbits is 6.

Similarly, for the 90° rotation, the number is 2.

Therefore, the total number of colorings where the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation is 2 + 6 = 8.

But wait, some colorings might be counted in both.

Specifically, the colorings where the blue set is both a 4-cycle and a union of two 2-cycles.

But in reality, the two colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are fixed by both 90° and 180° rotations.

Because {0,2,4,6} is an orbit under both 90° and 180° rotations.

Wait, no, under 180° rotation, {0,2,4,6} is not an orbit, because each orbit under 180° is a pair.

Wait, actually, under 180° rotation, {0,4} is an orbit, {1,5}, etc.

Therefore, {0,2,4,6} is not an orbit under 180° rotation.

Wait, but {0,2,4,6} can be expressed as the union of two orbits under 180° rotation: {0,4} and {2,6}.

Similarly, {1,3,5,7} is the union of {1,5} and {3,7}.

Therefore, the colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are counted in both the 90° and 180° counts.

Therefore, when we count 2 colorings for 90° and 6 colorings for 180°, we have overlapping colorings.

Specifically, the two colorings are each counted once in 90° and twice in 180°.

Therefore, total unique colorings would be 2 + 6 - 2 = 6.

Wait, because the two colorings are each counted twice (once in 90° and once in 180°), so we subtract 2 duplicates.

Therefore, the total number of colorings where the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation is 6.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 6.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{6}{\binom{8}{4}} = \frac{6}{70}\).

But wait, \(\binom{8}{4}\) is 70, so the probability is \(\frac{6}{70} = \frac{3}{35}\).

But hold on, is that correct?

Wait, let me verify.

Total number of colorings with exactly 4 blue vertices: 70.

Number of such colorings where the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation: 6.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{6}{70} = \frac{3}{35}\).

But wait, 6 and 70 have a common factor of 2, so simplifying, it's \(\frac{3}{35}\).

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{3}{35}\), so \(m = 3\), \(n = 35\), and \(m + n = 38\).

Wait, but is this correct?

Wait, the total number of colorings where blue set is a union of orbits is 6.

But let me list them:

1. {0,2,4,6}

2. {1,3,5,7}

3. {0,2,4,6} union {1,5}

Wait, no, each of these must be a union of entire orbits.

Wait, no, for 180° rotation, the orbits are pairs, so to get 4 blue vertices, we need to choose two orbits.

Therefore, the colorings are:

1. {0,4}, {2,6}

2. {0,4}, {1,5}

3. {0,4}, {2,6}

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, actually, the orbits under 180° rotation are four pairs: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

Therefore, to get a blue set of size 4, we need to choose two of these four pairs.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).

These colorings are:

1. {0,4} and {1,5}

2. {0,4} and {2,6}

3. {0,4} and {3,7}

4. {1,5} and {2,6}

5. {1,5} and {3,7}

6. {2,6} and {3,7}

So, these are the 6 colorings where the blue set is a union of two orbits under 180° rotation.

Additionally, the two colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are also colorings where the blue set is an orbit under 90° rotation.

Therefore, in total, we have 6 + 2 = 8 colorings.

But wait, the two colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are already included in the 6 colorings from the 180° rotation?

Wait, no, because the 6 colorings from 180° are pairs of pairs, which are different from the 4-cycles.

Therefore, these are unique colorings.

Therefore, total colorings are 6 (from 180°) + 2 (from 90°) = 8.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 8.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{8}{70}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{4}{35}\).

Wait, that seems different from before.

Wait, but hold on, are the colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} included in the 6 colorings from 180° rotation?

No, because the 6 colorings from 180° are all unions of two 2-cycles, while the two colorings from 90° are single 4-cycles.

Therefore, they are distinct.

Therefore, total colorings are 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{8}{70}\), which reduces to \(\frac{4}{35}\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\frac{4}{35}\), so \(m = 4\), \(n = 35\), and \(m + n = 39\).

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the two colorings from 90° are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

The six colorings from 180° are:

1. {0,4} and {1,5}

2. {0,4} and {2,6}

3. {0,4} and {3,7}

4. {1,5} and {2,6}

5. {1,5} and {3,7}

6. {2,6} and {3,7}

So, these are indeed distinct from the two colorings from 90°.

Therefore, total colorings where the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation is 8.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{8}{70} = \frac{4}{35}\).

So, the answer is \(\frac{4}{35}\), so \(m + n = 4 + 35 = 39\).

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, actually, no, because in the 90° case, the two colorings {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are each fixed by all four single 8-cycle rotations.

But when we counted the fixed colorings for each rotation, we had 2 fixed colorings per single 8-cycle rotation, but these two colorings are the same across all four rotations.

Therefore, in our inclusion-exclusion count, we have to consider that each of these two colorings is fixed by four different rotations, but we don't want to overcount them.

Wait, but in our previous approach, we considered the number of colorings fixed by each rotation, but since we need the colorings fixed by at least one rotation, we have to use inclusion-exclusion.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of colorings where the blue set is an orbit under some rotation.

Which we have found to be 8.

Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{8}{70}\), which is \(\frac{4}{35}\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{39}\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{39}

The problem involves finding the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex independently colored red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions originally occupied by red vertices. 

First, we note that the total number of possible colorings is \(2^8 = 256\). However, we are specifically interested in colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices, as the rotation must swap each blue vertex to a red one, implying an equal number of blue and red vertices. The number of such colorings is \(\binom{8}{4} = 70\).

Next, we need to determine how many of these 70 colorings allow for a rotation that maps all blue vertices to red vertices. This requires the blue vertices to form a union of orbits under some rotation. The possible rotations (permutations) of the octagon are analyzed, considering their cycle structures.

For each rotation, the cycle structure determines how the blue vertices can be arranged. Specifically, the blue vertices must be arranged such that they form either a single 4-cycle (for rotations by 90° or 270°) or a union of two 2-cycles (for rotation by 180°). 

- Rotations by 90° and 270° each contribute 2 colorings (the two 4-cycles: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}).
- Rotation by 180° contributes 6 colorings (each being a union of two 2-cycles: {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, and their combinations).

However, the two colorings from the 90° and 270° rotations are already included in the 6 colorings from the 180° rotation. Therefore, we avoid double-counting and find that there are 8 unique colorings where the blue set is a union of orbits under some rotation.

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{8}{70} = \frac{4}{35}\). The fraction \(\frac{4}{35}\) is in its simplest form, so \(m = 4\) and \(n = 35\), giving \(m + n = 39\).

\boxed{39}
