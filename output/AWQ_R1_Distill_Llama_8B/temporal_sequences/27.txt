Alright, let's try to figure out when Samantha could have gone to the bakery. So, the key points we have are:

1. **Samantha woke up at 5am.**
2. **Sarah saw Samantha buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 6am.**
3. **Richard saw Samantha waiting at the airport from 6am to 12pm.**
4. **John saw Samantha buying clothes at the mall from 12pm to 2pm.**
5. **Anthony saw Samantha sitting on a rooftop from 2pm to 3pm.**
6. **The bakery was closed after 9pm.**

First, let's list all the times when Samantha was seen by Sarah, Richard, John, and Anthony:

- **5am to 6am**: Electronics store with Sarah
- **6am to 12pm**: Airport with Richard
- **12pm to 2pm**: Mall with John
- **2pm to 3pm**: Rooftop with Anthony

Now, we need to find the time window when Samantha was not seen by anyone else, which would be the time she could have gone to the bakery.

Let's look at the timeline:

- **5am to 6am**: Sarah saw her at the electronics store.
- **6am to 12pm**: Richard saw her at the airport.
- **12pm to 2pm**: John saw her at the mall.
- **2pm to 3pm**: Anthony saw her on the rooftop.

So, between these times, there are gaps when Samantha wasn't seen by anyone else. Specifically:

- **From 3pm to 9pm**: After Anthony saw her on the rooftop, the bakery was closed after 9pm. So, Samantha could have gone to the bakery during this time.

But wait, the options given are:

(A) 6am to 12pm  
(B) 2pm to 3pm  
(C) 5am to 6am  
(D) 3pm to 9pm

So, the time Samantha wasn't seen by anyone else is from 3pm to 9pm, which is option (D).

However, I need to double-check if there's any overlap or if I missed something.

From the timeline:

- 5am to 6am: Electronics store
- 6am to 12pm: Airport
- 12pm to 2pm: Mall
- 2pm to 3pm: Rooftop

So, after 3pm, she wasn't seen until 9pm. But the bakery was closed after 9pm, so she couldn't have gone later than 9pm. Therefore, the latest she could have gone is by 9pm.

Hence, the correct time she could have gone to the bakery is from 3pm to 9pm, which is option (D).

The correct answer is (D) 3pm to 9pm.
