Okay, let's figure out between what times Michael could have gone to the clothing store. 

First, Michael's day starts at 10 am. Sean saw Michael at the theater from 10 am to 12 pm. So, Michael was at the theater during that time.

Then, Sarah saw Michael buying a phone at the electronics store from 4 pm to 6 pm. After that, Mary saw him buying a bike at the bike shop from 6 pm to 8 pm.

The clothing store was closed after 8 pm, so Michael couldn't have gone there after 8 pm.

Let's see the timeline:

- **10 am to 12 pm**: Michael was at the theater.
- **4 pm to 6 pm**: Michael was buying a phone.
- **6 pm to 8 pm**: Michael was buying a bike.

The clothing store is closed after 8 pm, so Michael couldn't have gone to the clothing store after 8 pm.

Looking at the options:

- (A) 6pm to 8pm: The clothing store was closed by 8 pm, so this is too late.
- (B) 4pm to 6pm: Michael was buying a phone during this time, so he wasn't at the clothing store.
- (C) 10am to 12pm: Michael was at the theater during this time.
- (D) 12pm to 4pm: There's no information that Michael was at the clothing store during this time.

So, none of the options fit because Michael was either at the theater, buying a phone, or buying a bike during those times. The clothing store was closed after 8 pm, so he couldn't have gone there.

Wait, but the question asks "Between what times could they have gone?" Maybe it's possible that the clothing store was open before the theater? Let me check again.

Michael woke up at 10 am. Sean saw him at the theater from 10 am to 12 pm. So, he was definitely at the theater during that time.

Before the theater, from 10 am, but was the clothing store open before that? The timeline starts at 10 am, and the first activity is the theater from 10 am to 12 pm.

There's no mention of the clothing store being open before 10 am or during the theater time. So, the earliest he could have gone to the clothing store would be after 12 pm but before 4 pm when he was buying a phone.

Wait, but he was buying a phone from 4 pm to 6 pm, so he was at the electronics store then. So, he couldn't have been at the clothing store during that time either.

Then, after buying the bike from 6 pm to 8 pm, the clothing store was closed after 8 pm, so he couldn't have gone there after that.

So, is there any time when he wasn't doing any of these activities? Let me see:

From 10 am to 12 pm: Theater

12 pm to 4 pm: No information, but he wasn't at the clothing store because he was buying a phone from 4 pm to 6 pm.

Wait, no, he wasn't buying the phone until 4 pm. So, between 12 pm and 4 pm, he wasn't at the store. But the clothing store was open during that time?

Wait, the clothing store was closed after 8 pm, but was it open before 8 pm? The problem says "The clothing store was closed after 8 pm." It doesn't specify when it was open. So, it was likely open before 8 pm.

So, the time when Michael wasn't at the theater, phone store, or bike shop is between 12 pm to 4 pm. That's when he could have gone to the clothing store.

So, the correct answer is (D) 12pm to 4pm.

The correct answer is (D) 12pm to 4pm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Michael's activities:**
   - **10 am - 12 pm:** At the theater.
   - **4 pm - 6 pm:** Buying a phone.
   - **6 pm - 8 pm:** Buying a bike.

2. **Determine the clothing store's operating hours:**
   - The clothing store was closed after 8 pm, implying it was open before 8 pm.

3. **Find the gap when Michael wasn't at the theater, phone store, or bike shop:**
   - After 12 pm, Michael was at the theater until 12 pm.
   - From 12 pm to 4 pm, there's no record of any activity except buying a phone starts at 4 pm.
   - Therefore, Michael could have gone to the clothing store between 12 pm and 4 pm.

Answer: (D) 12pm to 4pm
