Alright, let's try to figure out when Elizabeth could have gone to the swimming pool. I'll start by listing out the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, Elizabeth woke up at 5am. So that's our starting point.

Then, Jason saw Elizabeth taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 5am to 8am. So, she was taking photos during that time.

After that, John saw Elizabeth playing tennis at the tennis court from 8am to 10am. So, she was occupied with tennis from 8am to 10am.

Next, David saw Elizabeth buying a bike at the bike shop from 10am to 3pm. That means she spent some time at the bike shop, starting at 10am and ending at 3pm.

Finally, the swimming pool was closed after 4pm. So, the pool was only open until 4pm.

Now, let's piece this together. Elizabeth was taking photos from 5am to 8am. Then she played tennis from 8am to 10am. So, she was occupied until 10am.

She then went to buy a bike, which took her from 10am to 3pm. So, she was busy until 3pm.

The swimming pool was closed after 4pm, so the latest she could have gone is before 4pm.

Looking at her schedule, she was occupied from 5am to 3pm. But the pool was closed after 4pm, so she couldn't have gone to the pool during her time away.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. She was occupied the whole time until 3pm, and the pool was closed after 4pm. So, maybe she couldn't have gone at all? But the question says "Between what times could they have gone," implying that she did go.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the timeline again.

She was taking photos from 5am to 8am. Then tennis from 8am to 10am. Then buying a bike from 10am to 3pm.

So, from 5am to 3pm, she was occupied. The pool was closed after 4pm, so she couldn't have gone before 3pm.

Wait, but the options don't include 3pm to 4pm. Option C is 3pm to 4pm.

But according to the timeline, she was buying a bike until 3pm. So, she couldn't have gone to the pool during that time.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

If the pool was closed after 4pm, she could have gone any time before 4pm, but she was occupied until 3pm.

So, the only possible time would be between 3pm and 4pm, when she wasn't doing anything else.

But according to David, she was buying a bike from 10am to 3pm. So, she was occupied until 3pm.

Therefore, the only time she wasn't occupied was between 3pm and 4pm when the pool was still open.

So, the answer should be 3pm to 4pm, which is option C.

But wait, the options don't include 3pm to 4pm as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
(A) 8am to 10am
(B) 5am to 8am
(C) 3pm to 4pm
(D) 10am to 3pm

Yes, option C is 3pm to 4pm. So, that's the time she could have gone to the pool.

But earlier, I thought she was occupied until 3pm. However, the pool was closed after 4pm, so she had to go before 4pm.

But she was buying a bike until 3pm, so she couldn't have gone before that.

Wait, maybe she finished buying the bike at 3pm and then went to the pool. So, from 3pm to 4pm, the pool was still open.

Therefore, the correct time is 3pm to 4pm, which is option C.

But I'm not sure because she was buying a bike until 3pm. Maybe she couldn't have gone after that.

Wait, maybe she went to the pool before buying the bike? Let me check.

She was taking photos from 5am to 8am, then tennis from 8am to 10am, then buying a bike from 10am to 3pm.

So, she was occupied until 3pm. The pool was closed after 4pm, so she couldn't have gone before 4pm.

But she was busy until 3pm, so the only possible time is between 3pm and 4pm.

Therefore, the answer is C.

But the options don't include 3pm to 4pm as an option. Wait, they do. Option C is 3pm to 4pm.

So, the correct answer is C.

But wait, the pool was closed after 4pm, so she had to go before 4pm. But she was buying a bike until 3pm, so she couldn't have gone before that.

Therefore, the only time she could have gone is between 3pm and 4pm, when she wasn't buying the bike.

So, the answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because she was occupied until 3pm. But the pool was open until 4pm, so she could have gone after 3pm.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is C.
</think>

The swimming pool was closed after 4pm, and Elizabeth was occupied until 3pm. Therefore, the only possible time she could have gone to the swimming pool is between 3pm and 4pm.

**Answer:** (C) 3pm to 4pm
