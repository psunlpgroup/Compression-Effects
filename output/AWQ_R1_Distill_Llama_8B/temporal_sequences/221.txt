Alright, let's try to figure out when Betty could have gone to the coffee shop based on the information provided.

First, let's list out the times when Betty was seen doing different activities:

1. **Emily saw Betty buying a bike from 8am to 10am.**
2. **Susan saw Betty walking in the garden from 10am to 12pm.**
3. **John saw Betty working at the office from 1pm to 3pm.**
4. **Lisa saw Betty buying cookies at a bakery from 3pm to 4pm.**
5. **Mark saw Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 4pm to 5pm.**

Now, the coffee shop was closed after 5pm, so Betty could have gone there only before 5pm.

Looking at the times when Betty was seen:
- From 8am to 10am: She was buying a bike.
- From 10am to 12pm: She was walking in the garden.
- From 1pm to 3pm: She was working at the office.
- From 3pm to 4pm: She was buying cookies.
- From 4pm to 5pm: She was taking photos.

None of these times overlap with the coffee shop hours before 5pm. So, Betty didn't go to the coffee shop during these specific times.

But we need to find a time **between** these activities when she wasn't doing anything else. Let's check the gaps:

1. **Between 8am to 10am:** She was buying a bike.
2. **Between 10am to 12pm:** She was walking.
3. **Between 12pm to 1pm:** There's no activity mentioned here, so this is a possible time.
4. **Between 3pm to 4pm:** She was buying cookies.
5. **After 5pm:** Coffee shop was closed.

So, the only gap when Betty wasn't doing anything mentioned is between **12pm to 1pm**.

Therefore, Betty could have gone to the coffee shop between **12pm to 1pm**.

The correct answer is (D) 12pm to 1pm.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Betty was seen buying a bike from 8am to 10am, walking from 10am to 12pm, working from 1pm to 3pm, buying cookies from 3pm to 4pm, and taking photos from 4pm to 5pm.
2. The coffee shop was closed after 5pm, so she could have visited only before 5pm.
3. The only unaccounted-for time before 5pm is between 12pm and 1pm.

Answer: (D) 12pm to 1pm
