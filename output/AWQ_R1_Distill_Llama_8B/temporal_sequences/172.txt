Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Wake-up Time**: Leslie wakes up at 7am.

2. **William's Observation**: William saw Leslie working out at the gym from 6pm to 7pm.

3. **Mark's Observation**: Mark saw Leslie getting a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 8pm.

4. **Hannah's Observation**: Hannah saw Leslie taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 8pm to 10pm.

5. **Swimming Pool Closure**: The swimming pool was closed after 10pm.

Given this information, we can determine the possible times Leslie could have gone to the swimming pool.

- **From 7am to 6pm**: Leslie was either asleep or occupied elsewhere (working out, getting coffee, or taking photos). Therefore, it's unlikely Leslie went to the pool during this time.

- **From 6pm to 7pm**: William saw Leslie at the gym, so Leslie was not at the pool.

- **From 7pm to 8pm**: Mark saw Leslie getting coffee, so Leslie was not at the pool.

- **From 8pm to 10pm**: Hannah saw Leslie taking photos, and the swimming pool was closed after 10pm. Therefore, Leslie likely went to the pool between 8pm and 10pm.

Thus, the possible time Leslie could have gone to the swimming pool is **8pm to 10pm**.
