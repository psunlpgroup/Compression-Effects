Alright, let's try to figure out during which time Sarah could have gone to the amusement park. I'll start by listing out all the information provided and then analyze it step by step.

1. **Sarah's Wake-Up Time**: Sarah woke up at 10am. That's the earliest possible time she could have started her day.

2. **Anthony's Observation**: Anthony saw Sarah getting a coffee at the cafe from 11am to 12pm. So, during this time, Sarah was at the cafe, not at the amusement park.

3. **Andrew's Observation**: Andrew saw Sarah buying a phone at the electronics store from 12pm to 2pm. So, from 12pm to 2pm, Sarah was occupied with buying a phone, not at the amusement park.

4. **Kimberly's Observation**: Kimberly saw Sarah driving to the water park from 2pm to 7pm. Wait, this is interesting. Sarah was driving to the water park, not the amusement park, between 2pm and 7pm.

5. **Sarah's Observation**: Sarah attended class at the school from 7pm to 8pm. So, during this time, she was busy with class, not at the amusement park.

6. **Jennifer's Observation**: Jennifer saw Sarah watching a movie at the theater from 8pm to 10pm. So, Sarah was at the theater, not at the amusement park, during this time.

7. **Amusement Park Closing Time**: The amusement park was closed after 10pm. So, the latest possible time Sarah could have gone is by 10pm.

Now, let's see when Sarah was free to possibly go to the amusement park.

- **10am to 11am**: Sarah was at home since she just woke up at 10am. But Anthony saw her at the cafe from 11am to 12pm, so she left home around 11am.

- **12pm to 2pm**: She was buying a phone, so no time for the amusement park.

- **2pm to 7pm**: She was driving to the water park, so no time for the amusement park.

- **7pm to 8pm**: She was in class, so no time for the amusement park.

- **8pm to 10pm**: She was watching a movie, so no time for the amusement park.

Wait a minute, that doesn't leave any time for her to go to the amusement park. Did I miss something?

Oh, maybe I misinterpreted Kimberly's observation. She said she saw Sarah driving to the water park from 2pm to 7pm. So, Sarah was away from the amusement park during that time. But what about before 2pm?

Between 12pm and 2pm, she was buying a phone. So, she couldn't have gone to the amusement park then either.

But wait, is there any gap between 11am and 12pm when she was at the cafe? Let me check that again.

Yes, from 11am to 12pm, she was at the cafe, so she couldn't have gone to the amusement park then.

So, the only possible time she could have gone to the amusement park is before 10am, but she just woke up at 10am. So, there's no time between waking up and 10am to go to the park because she just woke up.

Hmm, this is confusing. The options given are:

(A) 2pm to 7pm  
(B) 12pm to 2pm  
(C) 10am to 11am  
(D) 7pm to 8pm  

But from the timeline, none of these times align with when Sarah was free. She was either at the cafe, buying a phone, driving to the water park, in class, or watching a movie. The amusement park was closed by 10pm, and she didn't have any free time before that.

Wait, maybe the answer is that none of these times are possible, but since the options are given, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Alternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me go through it again.

Sarah was at the cafe from 11am to 12pm, buying a phone from 12pm to 2pm, driving to the water park from 2pm to 7pm, in class from 7pm to 8pm, watching a movie from 8pm to 10pm.

She woke up at 10am, so before 11am, she was at home. So, between 10am and 11am, she was at home. Could she have gone to the amusement park during that time?

But the amusement park was closed after 10pm, so she could have gone any time before that, but she was at home from 10am to 11am. So, she could have gone to the park during 10am to 11am.

Wait, that's an option (C) 10am to 11am.

But earlier I thought she was at home, so that's possible.

So, maybe the correct answer is (C) 10am to 11am.

But I need to confirm.

Yes, she was at home from 10am to 11am, so she could have gone to the park during that time.

So, the answer is (C).

But wait, the options are:

(A) 2pm to 7pm  
(B) 12pm to 2pm  
(C) 10am to 11am  
(D) 7pm to 8pm  

So, the correct answer is (C) 10am to 11am.

I think that's it.

The correct answer is (C) 10am to 11am.
