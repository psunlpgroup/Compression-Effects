Alright, let's try to figure out when Betty could have gone to the dance studio. So, the problem gives us a timeline of Betty's activities and when others saw her. We need to piece this together to find the possible times she was at the dance studio.

First, let's list out all the information we have:

1. **Betty woke up at 7am.**
   
2. **Samantha saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe from 7am to 9am.**
   
3. **Leslie saw Betty waiting at the airport from 9am to 2pm.**
   
4. **Susan saw Betty working at the office from 5pm to 6pm.**
   
5. **Richard saw Betty waiting at the train station from 6pm to 8pm.**
   
6. **The dance studio was closed after 8pm.**

So, Betty was seen by Samantha from 7am to 9am. Then, Leslie saw her at the airport from 9am to 2pm. After that, Susan saw her at the office from 5pm to 6pm, and Richard saw her at the train station from 6pm to 8pm.

Now, the dance studio was closed after 8pm, which means Betty couldn't have gone there after 8pm.

Let's see when Betty was not seen by anyone else:

- From 2pm to 5pm: No one saw her during this time. So, this could be a window when she was at the dance studio.

- From 6pm to 8pm: Richard saw her at the train station, so she wasn't at the dance studio then.

- From 5pm to 6pm: Susan saw her at the office, so she wasn't at the dance studio.

- From 9am to 2pm: Leslie saw her at the airport.

- From 7am to 9am: Samantha saw her at the cafe.

So, the only time no one reported seeing her is between 2pm and 5pm. Since the dance studio was closed after 8pm, but she was at the train station until 8pm, she must have left the train station before 8pm.

Wait, but Richard saw her at the train station from 6pm to 8pm. So, she was there until 8pm, which is when the dance studio closed. So, she couldn't have gone to the dance studio after 8pm.

But between 2pm and 5pm, no one saw her, so that's a possible time.

Wait, but the options given are:

(A) 2pm to 5pm

(B) 7am to 9am

(C) 5pm to 6pm

(D) 9am to 2pm

So, the correct answer is (A) 2pm to 5pm.

But wait, let's double-check. She was at the airport from 9am to 2pm, so she left the airport around 2pm. Then, she went to the office from 5pm to 6pm, so she left the office at 6pm. Then, she went to the train station from 6pm to 8pm.

So, between 2pm and 5pm, she wasn't seen by anyone, so that's when she could have gone to the dance studio.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is (A) 2pm to 5pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (A) 2pm to 5pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Time Windows:**
   - **7am to 9am:** Betty was seen by Samantha at the cafe.
   - **9am to 2pm:** She was seen by Leslie at the airport.
   - **5pm to 6pm:** Susan saw her at the office.
   - **6pm to 8pm:** Richard saw her at the train station.

2. **Find the Gap:**
   - Between 2pm and 5pm, no one reported seeing Betty.

3. **Dance Studio Hours:**
   - The studio was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone after 8pm.

4. **Determine Possible Time:**
   - Since she wasn't seen between 2pm and 5pm, this is when she likely visited the dance studio.

**Answer:** (A) 2pm to 5pm
