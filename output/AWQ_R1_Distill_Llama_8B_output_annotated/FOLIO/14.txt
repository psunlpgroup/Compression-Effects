["initializing"] Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion that "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Let me break down the information step by step. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, the premise says that a Japanese game company created the game The Legend of Zelda. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] That's straightforward. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Now, the second part mentions that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, if a game is on that list, it must have been produced by a Japanese company. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, there's a conditional statement: If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, selling over a million copies is a sufficient condition for being on the list. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, it's given that The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, combining the second and third points, since it sold over a million, it should be on the list because of the conditional. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But wait, the premise also says that the company that made it is a Japanese one, which aligns with the second point that all games on the list are Japanese. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, putting it all together: The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese company, and since it sold over a million, it should be on the Top 10 list. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the conclusion that it's not on the list seems incorrect. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But wait, let me double-check. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The premise doesn't mention any exceptions or say that the Top 10 list only includes Japanese games made by certain companies or something like that. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] It clearly states that all games on the list are made by Japanese companies, and if a game sells over a million, it's on the list. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, since Zelda sold over a million and was made by a Japanese company, it should logically be on the list. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the conclusion that it's not on the list is false. ["end-section"]
