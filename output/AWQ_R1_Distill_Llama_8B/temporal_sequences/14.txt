Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Leslie could have gone to the clothing store. I'll start by listing out all the information provided and then see how it fits together.

First, Leslie woke up at 5am. That's a good starting point. So, the earliest Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is right after waking up, which is 5am.

Next, Richard saw Leslie buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. So, Richard saw Leslie during this time. That means Leslie was at the electronics store between 5am and 7am.

Then, Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm. So, at some point after 11am and before 6pm, Leslie was at the airport.

After that, David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. So, Leslie was at school between 6pm and 10pm.

Finally, the clothing store was closed after 10pm. That means the latest Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is by 10pm.

Now, let's try to piece this together. Leslie was at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. During that same time, Richard saw her there. So, that's her activity from 5am to 7am.

Then, Jason saw her at the airport from 11am to 6pm. So, she must have left the clothing store before 11am to go to the airport.

But wait, the clothing store was closed after 10pm. So, she couldn't have gone after 10pm.

Also, she was at school from 6pm to 10pm. So, she was occupied at school during that time.

Putting this all together, the times when she wasn't at the electronics store, airport, or school would be the times when she could have gone to the clothing store.

Let's see:

- 5am to 7am: At electronics store.
- 7am to 11am: Not accounted for.
- 11am to 6pm: At airport.
- 6pm to 10pm: At school.

So, the only time left is between 7am to 11am. That's when she wasn't doing any of the other activities mentioned.

But wait, let's double-check. The clothing store was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone after 10pm, which is consistent with her being at school until 10pm.

Therefore, the only available window is between 7am to 11am.

So, the correct answer should be between 7am to 11am, which is option (C).
