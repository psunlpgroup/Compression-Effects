Alright, let's break this down. The question is about finding the date when the Governor of a city ended. The city is where the basilica is dedicated to the same saint as Mantua Cathedral. 

First, I need to figure out who the saint is. Mantua Cathedral is dedicated to Saint Lawrence. So, the basilica in question is also dedicated to Saint Lawrence. 

Next, I need to identify which city has a basilica named after Saint Lawrence. I recall that there's a famous Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls in Rome. That's a significant basilica, so I'm guessing the city in question is Rome.

Now, I need to find out when the Governor of Rome ended his term or when he was no longer in office. Since the question is about the Governor ending, it's likely referring to the end of his term, which is when a new Governor is appointed or when the position is vacated.

I know that the position of Governor in Rome is a ceremonial role, not an elected office. The Governor represents the President of the Italian Republic in the city. The current Governor as of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024 is a political figure, but I don't have the exact date when their term ended.

However, since the question is about the Basilica of Saint Lawrence, which is a specific historical structure, I might be overcomplicating it. Perhaps it's referring to a historical Governor whose term ended around a specific event or date associated with the basilica.

I'm a bit unsure here. The Basilica of Saint Lawrence in Rome is an ancient site, but the Governor's term dates might not directly tie to the basilica's history. It's possible that the question is more about identifying the city (Rome) and then pinpointing a date when a Governor ended, but without more context, it's tricky.

In conclusion, the city is Rome, and the Governor's term likely ended around the time of a new election or appointment. Since I don't have the exact date, I might need to infer based on general knowledge or recognize that the question might be pointing towards a specific historical event related to the basilica and the Governor's role.
