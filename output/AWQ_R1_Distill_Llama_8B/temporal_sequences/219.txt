Alright, let's try to figure out when Sarah could have gone to the soccer field. I need to piece together the information from the timeline provided.

First, Sarah wakes up at 5am. That's the earliest time we know she's active.

Then, Linda saw Sarah taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 5am to 6am. So, Sarah was there between 5am and 6am.

Next, Kimberly saw Sarah playing tennis at the tennis court from 8am to 10am. So, Sarah was occupied with tennis during that time.

Jennifer saw Sarah buying cookies at a bakery from 10am to 7pm. That means Sarah was busy shopping and maybe eating cookies from 10am until 7pm.

Michael saw Sarah working at the office from 7pm to 9pm. So, in the evening, Sarah was at her office.

The soccer field was closed after 9pm. So, the latest time Sarah could have visited the soccer field is before 9pm.

Now, let's look at the times when Sarah wasn't doing the other activities:

- From 5am to 6am: She was taking photos.
- From 8am to 10am: She was playing tennis.
- From 10am to 7pm: She was buying cookies.
- From 7pm to 9pm: She was working at the office.

So, when could she have gone to the soccer field? It seems like the only time not covered by these activities is between 6am and 8am.

But wait, let me double-check:

- 5am to 6am: Photos
- 6am to 8am: No activity mentioned, so maybe free
- 8am to 10am: Tennis
- 10am to 7pm: Cookies
- 7pm to 9pm: Office

Yes, between 6am and 8am, Sarah wasn't doing any of the activities mentioned. That's probably when she went to the soccer field.

So, the answer should be (B) 6am to 8am.

The correct answer is (B) 6am to 8am.
