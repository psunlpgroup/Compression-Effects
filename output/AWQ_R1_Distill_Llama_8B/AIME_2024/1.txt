Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B given in the coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, but not as high as (0,1); instead, it's at sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So, point B is above point A in the first quadrant.

Then, there's this family of segments, called F, which are segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ in F starts somewhere on the x-axis, say at (p, 0), and ends at some point on the y-axis, say (0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, which means p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0, tracing out the unit circle in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem states that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is a specific segment from F? Let me check: points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F, since its length is 1.

Therefore, AB is one of the segments in F. So, the family F includes AB, but also includes all other unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB (not equal to A or B) that is not on any other segment from F. So, C is on AB, and no other segment PQ in F passes through C.

So, we need to find such a point C, and compute OC^2, which is the square of its distance from the origin, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's parametrize segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write parametric equations for AB. Let's let t vary from 0 to 1.

So, for t in [0,1], the coordinates of a point C on AB can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, when t=0, we get A, and when t=1, we get B. So, C is ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t in (0,1).

Now, we need to find t such that the point C is not on any other segment PQ in F. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, the equation of the line PQ must not pass through C, except for the case when PQ is AB itself.

So, to rephrase, for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other (p,0) on x-axis and (0,q) on y-axis with p^2 + q^2 =1), the line PQ should not pass through point C.

But since C is on AB, and AB is a segment in F, we need to find C such that for all other PQ in F, PQ does not pass through C.

Alternatively, point C is on AB, but it's not on any other PQ in F.

So, perhaps we can consider the equation of line PQ for any p and q, and find the conditions on C so that it doesn't satisfy that equation for any p and q except when PQ is AB.

So, let's write the equation of the line PQ. Points P(p,0) and Q(0,q). The slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, for any PQ in F, the line is y = (-q/p)x + q, with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, if point C(x, y) is on this line, then y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since C is on AB, we can substitute C's coordinates in terms of t into this equation.

So, plugging in x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t into the equation of line PQ:

(sqrt(3)/2) t = (-q/p) * (1 - t)/2 + q

So, we have:

(sqrt(3)/2) t = (-q/p)(1 - t)/2 + q

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(3) t = (-q/p)(1 - t) + 2q

Let me rearrange this equation:

sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q

So, sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q

Hmm, so we have an equation involving p and q, but since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa.

But perhaps another approach: Let's consider that for point C to lie on PQ, it must satisfy the above equation. But since we want C to not lie on any other PQ except AB, we can think of this equation having no solution for p and q except when PQ is AB.

So, for point C, the equation sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q must have no solution for p and q with p^2 + q^2 =1, except when PQ is AB.

But what is PQ in this case? When PQ is AB, then P is A, which is (1/2, 0), and Q is B, which is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, in this case, plugging into the equation:

sqrt(3) t + ( (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (1/2) )(1 - t) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2)

Simplify:

sqrt(3) t + (sqrt(3))(1 - t) = sqrt(3)

Which is:

sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) t = sqrt(3)

Which simplifies to sqrt(3) = sqrt(3), which is always true.

So, that's just the case when PQ is AB, which is consistent.

But for other PQs, meaning other p and q, we need this equation to have no solution.

So, the equation is sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q.

Let me try to express this equation in terms of p and q, with the constraint p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, we can write the equation as:

sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q

Let me denote s = q/p. Then, since p^2 + q^2 =1, we have q = s p, so s^2 p^2 + p^2 =1, so p^2(s^2 +1) =1, so p = 1/sqrt(s^2 +1). So, p is expressed in terms of s.

But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, let's express q in terms of p.

From p^2 + q^2 =1, we have q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, q is a function of p.

So, substituting q = sqrt(1 - p^2) into the equation:

sqrt(3) t + (sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)(1 - t) = 2 sqrt(1 - p^2)

Hmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can manipulate it.

Let me denote p as a variable, and t as a parameter. So, for point C on AB, we have to ensure that the equation above has no solution for p in (0,1).

Wait, but actually, for each t, this equation could have a solution p, but we want that for our specific t, there is no p in (0,1) that satisfies the equation, except for the case when p=1/2, which is the case of AB.

Therefore, the equation sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q must have no solution for p in (0,1) except when p=1/2.

So, to find such t, we can set up the equation and see for which t, the equation has only one solution p=1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as an equation in p, and analyze when it has exactly one solution.

So, let's rewrite the equation:

sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2q

Multiply both sides by p:

sqrt(3) t p + q (1 - t) = 2 q p

Bring all terms to one side:

sqrt(3) t p + q (1 - t) - 2 q p = 0

Factor terms:

p (sqrt(3) t - 2 q) + q (1 - t) = 0

So, we have:

p (sqrt(3) t - 2 q) = - q (1 - t)

So,

p = [ - q (1 - t) ] / (sqrt(3) t - 2 q )

But since p and q are positive (they lie in the first quadrant), the denominator and numerator must have the same sign.

But let's express p in terms of q:

p = [ - q (1 - t) ] / (sqrt(3) t - 2 q )

But p must be positive, so numerator and denominator must be both positive or both negative.

But let's see.

Wait, since p is positive, numerator and denominator must have the same sign.

So, either:

- q (1 - t) > 0 and sqrt(3) t - 2 q > 0

Or

- q (1 - t) < 0 and sqrt(3) t - 2 q < 0

But since q is positive (as it's on the y-axis in the first quadrant), -q (1 - t) is positive if (1 - t) is negative, i.e., t >1, but t is in (0,1), so (1 - t) is positive, so -q (1 - t) is negative.

Similarly, sqrt(3) t - 2 q is in the denominator.

So, since numerator is negative, denominator must also be negative for p to be positive.

Thus:

sqrt(3) t - 2 q < 0

So,

sqrt(3) t < 2 q

But q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Hmm, maybe better to express q in terms of p.

Wait, but we can also express q in terms of t.

Wait, perhaps we can use the parametric equations of AB.

Wait, point C is on AB, so its coordinates are ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2 ) t ). So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2 ) t.

So, in the equation of PQ, which is y = (-q/p)x + q, substituting x and y:

(sqrt(3)/2 ) t = (-q/p) * ( (1 - t)/2 ) + q

So, that's the equation we had earlier.

So, sqrt(3) t = (-q/p)(1 - t) + 2 q

Let me write this equation again:

sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t) = 2 q

We can rearrange this as:

sqrt(3) t = 2 q - (q/p)(1 - t)

So,

sqrt(3) t = q [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ]

But q = sqrt(1 - p^2)

So,

sqrt(3) t = sqrt(1 - p^2) [ 2 - (1 - t)/p ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can square both sides or something.

But perhaps another approach: For point C to not lie on any other PQ, the line PQ must not pass through C for any other p and q.

So, perhaps we can find the envelope of all these lines PQ, and then find a point C on AB that is not on the envelope except for AB itself.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then the envelope would consist of all points where the lines PQ are tangent to it. So, if C is on AB and not on the envelope, then C would not lie on any other PQ.

But since AB is part of the family F, it would be tangent to the envelope at some point.

Wait, but we need a point C on AB that is not on any other PQ, so maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is the curve that touches each PQ line at some point, so any point on the envelope is on at least one PQ line. So, if we can find the envelope, then the points not on the envelope are not on any PQ line.

But in our case, we need a point C on AB which is not on any other PQ, so C is on AB and not on the envelope, except for AB itself.

Wait, but AB is part of the family, so the envelope must be tangent to AB at some point.

Therefore, if we can compute the envelope, the point of tangency on AB would be our C.

So, let's compute the envelope of the family F.

The family F consists of lines PQ where P(p, 0) and Q(0, q) with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, each line can be written as y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method for finding envelopes of a family of curves.

The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(x, y, p, q) = y + (q/p)x - q = 0

G(x, y, p, q) = p^2 + q^2 - 1 = 0

But actually, F is y + (q/p)x - q = 0, and G is p^2 + q^2 -1 =0.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method where we write F and G, then eliminate p and q.

Alternatively, since the envelope is given by the solutions to F and G, but we can parameterize p and q as p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), because p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, let's parameterize p and q as p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), with theta in [0, pi/2).

Then, the equation of the line PQ is y = (-sin(theta)/cos(theta)) x + sin(theta) = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, the envelope is found by solving the system:

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta)

p^2 + q^2 =1

But since we have already parameterized p and q in terms of theta, maybe we can eliminate theta.

Let me denote m = -tan(theta), so that the equation becomes y = m x + sin(theta).

But m = -tan(theta), so tan(theta) = -m.

Since p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), we can express sin(theta) = q, cos(theta) = p.

But tan(theta) = -m = -(-q/p) = q/p.

So, m = -tan(theta) = q/p.

So, y = (q/p) x + q.

Wait, that's the same as earlier.

So, to find the envelope, we can write y = m x + sin(theta), with m = q/p, and p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, we can write sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - p^2), and m = q/p.

But perhaps we can write sin(theta) in terms of m.

Wait, since m = q/p, so q = m p.

Then, p^2 + q^2 =1 becomes p^2 + m^2 p^2 =1, so p^2 (1 + m^2) =1, so p = 1/sqrt(1 + m^2).

Similarly, sin(theta) = q = m p = m / sqrt(1 + m^2).

So, the equation of the line is y = m x + sin(theta) = m x + m / sqrt(1 + m^2).

Wait, but that might not be the right way to approach it.

Alternatively, we can write the equation y = (-tan(theta))x + sin(theta) and p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta).

So, perhaps we can write the envelope by considering the line equation and the parameter theta.

Alternatively, to find the envelope, we can write the equation of the line as F(x, y, theta) = y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta) =0, but wait, no.

Wait, earlier, we had y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, F(x, y, theta) = y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta) =0.

Then, the envelope is found by solving F(x, y, theta) =0 and dF/d theta =0.

So, compute dF/d theta:

dF/d theta = y * d/d theta [tan(theta)] + tan(theta) * d/d theta [x] - d/d theta [sin(theta)] = y * sec^2(theta) + 0 - cos(theta) =0.

So, y sec^2(theta) - cos(theta) =0.

So, y sec^2(theta) = cos(theta).

So, y = cos(theta) * cos^2(theta) = cos^3(theta).

So, y = cos^3(theta).

But we also have from the line equation:

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, substitute y = cos^3(theta) into the line equation:

cos^3(theta) = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

But tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta), so:

cos^3(theta) = - (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) x + sin(theta)

Multiply both sides by cos(theta):

cos^4(theta) = - sin(theta) x + sin(theta) cos(theta)

Bring all terms to left:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta) x - sin(theta) cos(theta) =0

Factor sin(theta):

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

So, we have:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

We can express this in terms of cos(theta) and sin(theta):

Let me write it as:

cos^4(theta) + x sin(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) =0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can express everything in terms of sin(theta) or cos(theta).

Alternatively, let's try to express x in terms of theta.

From the equation:

cos^4(theta) + x sin(theta) - sin(theta) cos(theta) =0

So,

x sin(theta) = sin(theta) cos(theta) - cos^4(theta)

Divide both sides by sin(theta) (assuming sin(theta) ≠0, which it isn't in (0, pi/2)):

x = cos(theta) - cos^3(theta)/sin(theta)

But sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)), so:

x = cos(theta) - cos^3(theta)/sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta))

Hmm, this is still complicated.

Alternatively, let's denote u = cos(theta), so that sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - u^2). Then, x = u - u^3 / sqrt(1 - u^2)

But that might not help.

Alternatively, let's square both sides:

From x = cos(theta) - cos^3(theta)/sin(theta)

Multiply both sides by sin(theta):

x sin(theta) = cos(theta) sin(theta) - cos^4(theta)

So,

x sin(theta) + cos^4(theta) = cos(theta) sin(theta)

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the envelope as a parametric curve.

Given that y = cos^3(theta), and x is expressed in terms of theta.

From the equation x = cos(theta) - cos^3(theta)/sin(theta)

We can write x as:

x = cos(theta) - cos^3(theta)/sin(theta)

But sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)), so:

x = u - u^3 / sqrt(1 - u^2), where u = cos(theta)

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express everything in terms of t.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use Lagrange multipliers to find the envelope.

Wait, the envelope is found by the condition that the line is tangent to the curve p^2 + q^2 =1.

Wait, but in this case, the family of lines is not a curve but a set of lines, so the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each line at some point.

Wait, but in our case, each line PQ is tangent to the unit circle at point (p, q). Wait, but PQ is the line connecting (p,0) to (0,q), which is a secant line, not a tangent.

Wait, perhaps I was confused earlier. The envelope of the family of lines PQ is the curve that is tangent to each line PQ at some point.

So, each line PQ is tangent to the envelope at some point (x, y).

So, the envelope is a curve such that each line PQ touches it at exactly one point.

Therefore, to find the envelope, we can use the standard method where we write the line equation and the constraint, then take partial derivatives.

So, the line PQ is given by y = (-q/p)x + q.

But with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, let me write F(x, y, p, q) = y + (q/p)x - q =0

And G(p, q) = p^2 + q^2 -1 =0

Then, the envelope is found by solving F=0 and dF=0 with respect to p and q.

But wait, actually, for the envelope, we need to solve F=0 and dF/d theta =0, where theta parameterizes p and q.

But perhaps another approach: Since p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2=1, we can express q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, substituting into the line equation:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p) x + sqrt(1 - p^2)

So, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2)

But this is a single-variable equation in terms of p. So, to find the envelope, we can write y in terms of p, and then take derivative with respect to p and set it to zero.

Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the condition that the line is tangent to the unit circle.

Wait, but PQ is a secant, not a tangent.

Wait, perhaps another way: The envelope of lines PQ is the set of points (x, y) such that (x, y) lies on PQ and the derivative of PQ with respect to parameter p equals the slope of PQ.

Wait, I think that's the standard way.

So, the line PQ is given by y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2).

So, the line can be written as y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

So, the envelope is the set of points (x, y) where y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2) and d/dp [ y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2) ] =0.

So, compute derivative with respect to p:

dy/dp = [ d/dp (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p x + sqrt(1 - p^2)) ]

= [ derivative of (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p x ) ] + derivative of sqrt(1 - p^2)

Compute each term:

First term: d/dp [ (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p )x ].

Let me compute derivative of (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p ):

Let f(p) = (-sqrt(1 - p^2))/p.

f'(p) = [ ( (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2)*(2p) ) * p + sqrt(1 - p^2) ] / p^2

Wait, no, better to use quotient rule:

f(p) = (-sqrt(1 - p^2))/p.

So, f'(p) = [ ( (-1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2)*(-2p) ) * p - (-sqrt(1 - p^2)) *1 ] / p^2

Wait, wait:

f'(p) = [ ( derivative of numerator * denominator - numerator * derivative of denominator ) ] / denominator^2

Numerator = -sqrt(1 - p^2), denominator = p.

So,

f'(p) = [ ( (-1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2)*(-2p) ) * p - (-sqrt(1 - p^2)) *1 ] / p^2

Simplify numerator:

First term: ( (1/2)(2p)(sqrt(1 - p^2)) ) * p = (p * sqrt(1 - p^2)) * p = p^2 sqrt(1 - p^2)

Second term: - (-sqrt(1 - p^2)) = sqrt(1 - p^2)

So, total numerator:

p^2 sqrt(1 - p^2) + sqrt(1 - p^2) = sqrt(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 )

Thus,

f'(p) = [ sqrt(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 ) ] / p^2

So, derivative of first term is [ sqrt(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 ) ] / p^2

Then, derivative of sqrt(1 - p^2) is (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-1/2)*(-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p^2)

So, putting it all together:

dy/dp = [ sqrt(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 ) / p^2 ] x + [ -p / sqrt(1 - p^2) ]

Set dy/dp =0 for the envelope:

[ sqrt(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 ) / p^2 ] x - p / sqrt(1 - p^2) =0

Multiply both sides by p^2 sqrt(1 - p^2) to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(1 - p^2) * sqrt(1 - p^2) (p^2 +1 ) x - p * p^2 =0

Simplify:

(1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 )x - p^3=0

Note that (1 - p^2)(p^2 +1 ) =1 - p^4

So,

(1 - p^4)x - p^3 =0

Thus,

(1 - p^4)x = p^3

So,

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4)

But from the line equation, we have:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p )x + sqrt(1 - p^2)

So, substitute x:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p ) * [ p^3 / (1 - p^4) ] + sqrt(1 - p^2)

Simplify:

First term: (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p ) * [ p^3 / (1 - p^4) ] = (-p^{3/2} sqrt(1 - p^2)) / (1 - p^4) * p

Wait, perhaps better step by step:

First term:

(-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p ) * (p^3 / (1 - p^4)) = (-sqrt(1 - p^2) * p^2 ) / (1 - p^4 )

Second term: sqrt(1 - p^2)

So, total:

y = [ (-sqrt(1 - p^2) * p^2 ) / (1 - p^4 ) ] + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

Factor sqrt(1 - p^2):

y = sqrt(1 - p^2) [ (-p^2)/(1 - p^4) +1 ]

Simplify the bracket:

(-p^2)/(1 - p^4) +1 = [ -p^2 + (1 - p^4) ] / (1 - p^4 ) = [1 - p^2 - p^4 ] / (1 - p^4 )

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / (1 - p^4 ) ]

Factor numerator:

1 - p^2 - p^4 = -(p^4 + p^2 -1 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor it as:

1 - p^2 - p^4 = (1 - p^2) - p^4 = (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) - p^4 - (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ?

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that 1 - p^4 = (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2)

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

Simplify:

y = sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

= sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

Cancel out (1 - p^2):

= sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

= sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ ( - p^4 +1 - p^2 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

= sqrt(1 - p^2) * [ ( - (p^4 -1 + p^2) ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) ) ]

Hmm, this seems too complicated.

Wait, maybe we can express y in terms of x.

From x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me solve for p.

Let me set u = p^2, so that p = sqrt(u).

Then,

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 ) = u^(3/2) / (1 - u^2 )

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me write x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

x (1 - p^4 ) = p^3

So,

x - x p^4 = p^3

Bring all terms to left:

x - x p^4 - p^3 =0

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me write this as:

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Then, x = p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) )

So,

x = p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2) )

So,

x = p^3 / (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 )

But also, from the line equation:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p )x + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

So,

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p ) * [ p^3 / (1 - p^4 ) ] + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

Simplify:

= (-p^{3/2} sqrt(1 - p^2 )) / (1 - p^4 ) + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

Factor sqrt(1 - p^2 ):

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) [ -p^{3/2} / (1 - p^4 ) +1 ]

Hmm, perhaps express 1 - p^4 as (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 )

So,

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) [ -p^{3/2} / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) +1 ]

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) [ (-p^{3/2} + (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 )) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

-p^{3/2} + (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) = -p^{3/2} + (1 - p^4 )

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) [ (1 - p^4 - p^{3/2} ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) ]

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) [ (1 - p^4 - p^{3/2} ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) ]

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^4 - p^{3/2} ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

Simplify sqrt(1 - p^2 ) / (1 - p^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - p^2 )

So,

y = (1 - p^4 - p^{3/2} ) / ( (1 + p^2 ) sqrt(1 - p^2 ) )

This is getting too complex. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can relate x and y through the parametrization.

From x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 ), so x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me solve for p in terms of x.

Let me denote x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me denote u = p^2, so that p = sqrt(u), u in (0,1).

Then,

x = (u^{3/2}) / (1 - u^2 )

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me consider that x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x (1 - p^4 ) = p^3

So,

x - x p^4 = p^3

Bring all terms to left:

x - x p^4 - p^3 =0

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Then, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me write x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 ) = p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

So, x = p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

Similarly, from the line equation:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2 ) / p ) x + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

We can write:

y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( 1 - x / p )

But from x = p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ), so 1 - x / p = 1 - [ p^2 / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) ]

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parametrize the envelope in terms of theta.

Given that x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 ), and y = something in terms of p.

But it's too involved.

Wait, perhaps we can use substitution.

Let me note that x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x (1 - p^4 ) = p^3

So,

x - x p^4 = p^3

Bring all terms to left:

x - x p^4 - p^3 =0

Hmm, maybe factor:

x (1 - p^4 ) - p^3 =0

Hmm, perhaps factor p^3:

x (1 - p^4 ) - p^3 =0

But not obvious.

Alternatively, let me write as:

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me write this as x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me consider that p is small, so near p=0, but not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps try specific p to see.

Wait, but maybe we can find a relation between x and y.

From x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

And from y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2 ) / p )x + sqrt(1 - p^2 )

So, y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) - (sqrt(1 - p^2 ) / p ) x

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( 1 - x / p )

But from x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

x / p = p^2 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( 1 - p^2 / (1 - p^4 ) )

Simplify:

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) / (1 - p^4 ) )

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) / (1 - p^4 ) )

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps write 1 - p^4 - p^2 = -(p^4 + p^2 -1 )

But not helpful.

Alternatively, note that 1 - p^4 = (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 )

So,

y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) )

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) ) )

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^4 - p^2 ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) ] / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= sqrt(1 - p^2 ) * (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / ( (1 - p^2)(1 + p^2 ) )

= [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / (1 + p^2 ) ] * sqrt(1 - p^2 ) / (1 - p^2 )

= [ (1 - p^2 - p^4 ) / (1 + p^2 ) ] * 1 / sqrt(1 - p^2 )

This is still not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a relation between x and y.

From x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me write x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Similarly, from y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) ( 1 - x / p )

So, y = sqrt(1 - p^2 ) (1 - x / p )

So, if we can express y in terms of x, maybe.

From x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

Let me solve for p in terms of x.

But that might be difficult.

Alternatively, note that p^4 = p * x

So, p^4 = p x

But p^4 = p x => p^3 = x

So, p = x^{1/3}

Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, if p^4 = p x, then p^4 - p x =0, so p(p^3 -x )=0, so p=0 or p=x^{1/3}

But p=0 is trivial, so p= x^{1/3}

Wait, but that might not hold because p is related to x through the equation x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So, if p^4 = p x, then substituting into x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 ) gives x = p^3 / (1 - p x )

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write x = p^3 / (1 - p^4 )

So,

x (1 - p^4 ) = p^3

So,

x - x p^4 = p^3

So,

x = p^3 + x p^4

Factor p^3:

x = p^3 (1 + x p )

Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider x as a function of p, and then find a relation between x and y.

But I think this approach is getting too bogged down.

Perhaps another method: If we have a point C on AB which is not on any other PQ, then the line AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

So, since AB is part of the family F, and the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each line in F, then AB is tangent to the envelope at point C.

Therefore, point C is the point of tangency on AB.

Thus, to find C, we can compute the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

So, in this case, since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, which is on AB, so we can compute C by finding the point on AB where the envelope is tangent.

So, to find this point C, we can compute the point on AB where the envelope has a single intersection with AB.

So, in other words, AB is a member of the family F, so it's one of the lines in F, and the envelope is tangent to AB at some point C.

Therefore, to find C, we can solve for the point on AB where the envelope is tangent to AB.

So, perhaps we can parametrize AB and find where the derivative matches the envelope's derivative.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since AB is a member of F, its equation is y = (-q/p)x + q, with p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.

So, the equation is y = (- (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (1/2) ) x + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3))x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each line in F, so in particular, it is tangent to AB at some point.

Therefore, we can find the point C on AB where the envelope is tangent to AB.

So, to find C, we can find the point where the envelope's derivative equals the derivative of AB at that point.

So, compute the derivative of AB.

AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, dy/dx = -sqrt(3).

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

Similarly, the envelope's slope at point C must be equal to -sqrt(3).

So, the envelope's derivative at point C is -sqrt(3).

So, to find C, we need to solve the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

2. dy/dx = -sqrt(3).

But how does dy/dx relate to the envelope?

Wait, since the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each line in F, the derivative of the envelope at the point of tangency equals the slope of the line.

So, at point C, which is on AB and on the envelope, the derivative of the envelope is equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

Therefore, we can compute the derivative of the envelope at point C and set it equal to -sqrt(3).

But how to compute the derivative of the envelope?

Wait, the envelope can be found as the solution to F=0 and dF/d theta=0.

Earlier, we had F(x, y, theta)= y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta)=0.

And dF/d theta= y sec^2(theta) - cos(theta)=0.

So, solving these two equations:

1. y + tan(theta) x - sin(theta)=0

2. y sec^2(theta) - cos(theta)=0

From equation 2: y = cos(theta) / sec^2(theta) = cos(theta) cos^2(theta) = cos^3(theta)

So, y = cos^3(theta)

From equation 1:

cos^3(theta) + tan(theta) x - sin(theta)=0

But tan(theta)= sin(theta)/cos(theta), so:

cos^3(theta) + (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) x - sin(theta)=0

Multiply both sides by cos(theta):

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta) x - sin(theta) cos(theta)=0

Which is the same as earlier.

So, cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

But we know that y = cos^3(theta), and point C is on AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, set y = cos^3(theta) = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

And from the envelope condition:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

So, we have two equations:

1. cos^3(theta) = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

2. cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

So, now we can try to solve for theta, x, and y.

So, from equation 1:

x = (sqrt(3)/2 - cos^3(theta)) / sqrt(3)

= 1/2 - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3)

Substitute x into equation 2:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)( [1/2 - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3) ] - cos(theta) )=0

Simplify the term inside the parenthesis:

1/2 - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3) - cos(theta)

= 1/2 - cos(theta) - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3)

So, equation 2 becomes:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta) [ 1/2 - cos(theta) - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3) ] =0

So, we have:

cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(1/2 - cos(theta) - (cos^3(theta))/sqrt(3) ) =0

This equation is in terms of theta. So, we can try to solve for theta.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution.

Let me denote u = cos(theta), so that sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - u^2 )

Then, equation becomes:

u^4 + sqrt(1 - u^2 ) [ 1/2 - u - (u^3)/sqrt(3) ] =0

So,

u^4 + sqrt(1 - u^2 ) [ 1/2 - u - (u^3)/sqrt(3) ] =0

This is still complicated, but maybe we can find a value of u that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can guess that u is a rational multiple of sqrt(3) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps try specific values for u.

Suppose u=1/2.

Then,

(1/2)^4 + sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 ) [ 1/2 - 1/2 - ( (1/2)^3 ) / sqrt(3) ]

=1/16 + sqrt(3/4 ) [ 0 - (1/8)/sqrt(3) ]

=1/16 + (sqrt(3)/2 ) ( -1/(8 sqrt(3)) )

=1/16 - (1/16 )

=0

Wow, that works!

So, u=1/2 is a solution.

Therefore, cos(theta)=1/2, so theta=60 degrees, pi/3.

So, cos(theta)=1/2, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2.

So, then, point C is on AB with y=cos^3(theta)= (1/2)^3=1/8.

But wait, y=cos^3(theta)=1/8.

But also, from AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, 1/8 = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So,

sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2 - 1/8

So,

x= (sqrt(3)/2 - 1/8 ) / sqrt(3 )

= ( (4 sqrt(3) -1 ) /8 ) / sqrt(3 )

= (4 sqrt(3) -1 ) / (8 sqrt(3) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):

= (4*3 - sqrt(3) ) / (8*3 )

= (12 - sqrt(3) ) /24

Simplify:

= (12 - sqrt(3))/24 = (4 - sqrt(3)/3 ) /8 ?

Wait, no, 12/24=1/2, sqrt(3)/24= sqrt(3)/24.

Wait, (12 - sqrt(3))/24= (12/24 ) - (sqrt(3)/24 )= 1/2 - sqrt(3)/24.

So, x=1/2 - sqrt(3)/24.

Wait, but in the coordinate system, points on AB are parameterized as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2 ) t )

So, if x=1/2 - sqrt(3)/24, and y=1/8.

So, let's see:

(1/2)(1 - t)=1/2 - sqrt(3)/24

So, 1 - t=1 - sqrt(3)/12

So, t= sqrt(3)/12

Then, y= (sqrt(3)/2 ) t= (sqrt(3)/2 )( sqrt(3)/12 )= (3)/24=1/8

Which matches.

So, t= sqrt(3)/12, so point C is ( (1/2)(1 - sqrt(3)/12 ), (sqrt(3)/2 )( sqrt(3)/12 ) )

= (1/2 - sqrt(3)/24, 1/8 )

Therefore, coordinates of C are (1/2 - sqrt(3)/24, 1/8 )

Therefore, OC^2= x^2 + y^2

So,

x=1/2 - sqrt(3)/24= (12/24 - sqrt(3)/24 )= (12 - sqrt(3))/24

So, x=(12 - sqrt(3))/24

Similarly, y=1/8=3/24

So,

OC^2= [ (12 - sqrt(3))/24 ]^2 + [ 3/24 ]^2

Compute each term:

First term: [ (12 - sqrt(3))/24 ]^2 = (144 -24 sqrt(3) +3 ) / 576= (147 -24 sqrt(3))/576

Second term: [3/24]^2=9/576=1/64

Wait, 9/576=1/64? No, 9/576=1/64 is incorrect.

Wait, 576 divided by 9 is 64, so 9/576=1/64.

Wait, actually, 9/576= (9)/(9*64)=1/64. Yes, correct.

So, OC^2= (147 -24 sqrt(3))/576 + 1/64

Convert 1/64 to 9/576:

= (147 -24 sqrt(3))/576 +9/576= (147 -24 sqrt(3)+9)/576= (156 -24 sqrt(3))/576

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 24*(6.5 - sqrt(3)) but not helpful.

Wait, 156 and 24 are both divisible by 12.

156=12*13, 24=12*2.

So,

(156 -24 sqrt(3))/576=12*(13 - 2 sqrt(3))/576= (13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48

So, OC^2= (13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48

Therefore, OC^2= (13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48.

So, p=13 - 2 sqrt(3), but wait, p and q must be integers.

Wait, but the problem says OC^2=p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers.

But here, OC^2=(13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48, which is not rational.

Wait, that can't be. So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recast.

Wait, OC^2= x^2 + y^2.

x= (12 - sqrt(3))/24= (12 - sqrt(3))/24

y=1/8=3/24

So, x= (12 - sqrt(3))/24= (12/24 - sqrt(3)/24 )= (1/2 - sqrt(3)/24 )

Similarly, y=3/24=1/8

So,

x^2= [ (12 - sqrt(3))/24 ]^2= (144 -24 sqrt(3) +3 ) / 576= (147 -24 sqrt(3))/576

y^2= (3/24)^2=9/576=1/64

So, OC^2= (147 -24 sqrt(3))/576 + 9/576= (147 -24 sqrt(3) +9 ) /576= (156 -24 sqrt(3))/576

Factor numerator: 12*(13 - 2 sqrt(3))

Denominator:576=24^2=576

So, OC^2= (12*(13 - 2 sqrt(3)) ) /576= (13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48

Hmm, same as before.

But this is not a rational number, which contradicts the problem statement which says OC^2=p/q where p and q are coprime integers.

So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that u=1/2 is the only solution?

Wait, when we set u=1/2, we found that it satisfies the equation, but maybe there are other solutions.

Wait, let me check again.

From equation 2: cos^4(theta) + sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))=0

We found that with u=1/2, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2, so:

cos^4(theta)= (1/2)^4=1/16

sin(theta)(x - cos(theta))= (sqrt(3)/2)(x -1/2 )

So,

1/16 + (sqrt(3)/2)(x -1/2 )=0

So,

(sqrt(3)/2)(x -1/2 )= -1/16

So,

x -1/2= - (1/16 )/(sqrt(3)/2 )= - (1)/(8 sqrt(3) )

So,

x=1/2 -1/(8 sqrt(3) )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, x=1/2 - sqrt(3)/24= (12 - sqrt(3))/24

So, that seems correct.

But then, OC^2= x^2 + y^2= (12 - sqrt(3))^2 /24^2 + (3)^2 /24^2= (144 -24 sqrt(3) +3 +9 ) /576= (156 -24 sqrt(3))/576= (13 -2 sqrt(3))/48

But this is not a rational number.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the point C is such that it's not on the envelope except for AB, but perhaps the envelope is a different curve.

Wait, maybe I should have thought differently.

Wait, the envelope is the curve that is tangent to all lines PQ in F, but in our case, the envelope is only tangent at one point, which is point C.

Wait, but actually, each line PQ is tangent to the envelope at some point, but AB is one of those lines, tangent at C.

So, perhaps the envelope is the union of all such tangent points, but since AB is just one line, the envelope is a curve.

But perhaps instead of computing the envelope, we can consider that point C is such that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ does not pass through C.

Therefore, point C is on AB and is not on any other PQ.

So, perhaps we can parametrize PQ as (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2=1.

The line PQ is given by y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, for point C(x, y) on AB, we have y = (-q/p)x + q.

But C is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, equate:

-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 = (-q/p) x + q

So,

(-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = (-q/p) x + q

We can rearrange:

(-sqrt(3) + q/p ) x = q - sqrt(3)/2

So,

(q/p - sqrt(3) ) x = q - sqrt(3)/2

So,

(q/p - sqrt(3) ) x - q + sqrt(3)/2 =0

Factor:

(q/p x - q ) - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 =0

So,

q (x/p -1 ) - sqrt(3)(x -1/2 )=0

But we also have p^2 + q^2=1.

So, we have two equations:

1. q (x/p -1 ) - sqrt(3)(x -1/2 )=0

2. p^2 + q^2=1

We need to solve for p and q, given x and y on AB.

But since C is on AB, x and y are related by y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, for each x, we can compute y, but then we have two equations with variables p and q.

So, let me express q from equation 1:

From equation 1:

q (x/p -1 ) = sqrt(3)(x -1/2 )

So,

q = sqrt(3)(x -1/2 ) / (x/p -1 )

But from equation 2: p^2 + q^2=1.

Substitute q:

p^2 + [ sqrt(3)(x -1/2 ) / (x/p -1 ) ]^2=1

This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, let's denote t = p.

So, p is in (0,1), and q= sqrt(1 - t^2 ).

So, equation 1:

sqrt(1 - t^2 ) (x/t -1 ) - sqrt(3)(x -1/2 )=0

So,

sqrt(1 - t^2 ) (x/t -1 )= sqrt(3)(x -1/2 )

Square both sides:

(1 - t^2 ) (x/t -1 )^2= 3 (x -1/2 )^2

But this is a complicated equation in t.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that for point C, there exists a unique p such that the equation holds, but for other p, the equation does not hold.

Therefore, for point C, the equation sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t )=2 q has exactly one solution p=1/2.

Therefore, the equation sqrt(3) t + (q/p)(1 - t )=2 q must have p=1/2 as its only solution.

So, to ensure that, the equation must have discriminant zero when p=1/2 is the only solution.

Alternatively, perhaps take derivative with respect to p and set it to zero.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps think geometrically.

Given that all lines PQ in F are tangent to the envelope, and AB is one of them tangent at C.

Therefore, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Therefore, the envelope is the set of all points where each PQ is tangent to the envelope.

But AB is one such tangent, touching at C.

Therefore, to find point C, we can parametrize the envelope and find where AB is tangent.

But I think we did this earlier.

Wait, we found that u=1/2 is a solution, so point C is (1/2 - sqrt(3)/24, 1/8 )

Therefore, OC^2= x^2 + y^2= [ (12 - sqrt(3))/24 ]^2 + [ 3/24 ]^2= (144 -24 sqrt(3)+3 +9 ) /576= (156 -24 sqrt(3))/576= (13 - 2 sqrt(3))/48

But since the problem states that OC^2=p/q with p and q coprime integers, but here we have an irrational number.

So, this suggests that my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I assumed the envelope is the curve to which AB is tangent, but actually, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent, but AB is just one PQ.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F.

But in reality, since all PQ lines are in the first quadrant, the envelope is actually a curve in the first quadrant.

But perhaps the envelope is the unit circle.

Wait, no, because each PQ is a secant line, not a tangent.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, the unit circle is the set of points where p^2 + q^2=1.

But each PQ is a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q), which is a secant line, not a tangent.

Therefore, the envelope is not the unit circle.

Wait, but the envelope is the curve tangent to each line PQ in F.

So, each line PQ is tangent to the envelope at some point.

Therefore, the envelope is different from the unit circle.

Therefore, perhaps the envelope is the astroid or something else.

Wait, actually, the envelope of lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2=1 is known as the astroid.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me recall: The envelope of the family of lines joining (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2=1 is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

Wait, let me check.

If we have lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2=1, then the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

Therefore, the astroid is the envelope.

Therefore, point C is the point on AB which is also on the astroid.

But since AB is a member of F, it is tangent to the astroid at point C.

Therefore, to find point C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

The line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:

1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1

And also, the derivative of the astroid at point C must equal the slope of AB.

So, compute dy/dx for the astroid.

Differentiate implicitly:

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0

So,

dy/dx= - (x^(-1/3) + y^(-1/3 )) / (2/3 )

= - (3)/(2) (x^(-1/3) + y^(-1/3 ))

The slope of AB is -sqrt(3), so set dy/dx= -sqrt(3 )

So,

- (3)/(2) (x^(-1/3) + y^(-1/3 )) = -sqrt(3 )

Multiply both sides by -2/3:

x^(-1/3) + y^(-1/3 )= (2 sqrt(3))/3

So,

1/x^(1/3) +1/y^(1/3 )= (2 sqrt(3))/3

So, now we have:

1. y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1

3. 1/x^(1/3) +1/y^(1/3 )= (2 sqrt(3))/3

So, three equations.

From equation 1: y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

From equation 2: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

From equation 3: 1/x^(1/3) +1/y^(1/3 )= (2 sqrt(3))/3.

So, let me denote u = x^(1/3), v = y^(1/3). Then, equation 2 becomes u^2 + v^2=1.

Equation 3 becomes 1/u +1/v= (2 sqrt(3))/3.

Equation 1: y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Expressed in terms of u and v: y= -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

But y= v^3, x= u^3.

So,

v^3= -sqrt(3)u^3 + sqrt(3)/2

So,

v^3 + sqrt(3)u^3= sqrt(3)/2

So, now, we have:

1. u^2 + v^2=1

2. 1/u +1/v= (2 sqrt(3))/3

3. v^3 + sqrt(3)u^3= sqrt(3)/2

So, let's solve these equations.

From equation 2:

1/u +1/v= (2 sqrt(3))/3

So,

(v + u ) / (u v )= (2 sqrt(3))/3

So,

u + v= (2 sqrt(3)/3 ) u v

From equation 1:

u^2 + v^2=1

We can write u^2 + v^2=1.

Let me denote s= u + v, p= u v.

Then, equation 2: s= (2 sqrt(3)/3 ) p

Equation 1: u^2 + v^2=1. But u^2 + v^2= (u + v)^2 - 2 u v= s^2 - 2 p=1.

So,

s^2 - 2 p=1

But s= (2 sqrt(3)/3 ) p

So,

( (2 sqrt(3)/3 ) p )^2 - 2 p=1

Compute:

(4*3 /9 ) p^2 - 2 p=1

Simplify:

(12/9 ) p^2 - 2 p=1 => (4/3 ) p^2 -2 p -1=0

Multiply both sides by 3:

4 p^2 -6 p -3=0

Quadratic equation:4 p^2 -6 p -3=0

Solutions:

p= [6 ± sqrt(36 +48 ) ] /8= [6 ± sqrt(84 ) ] /8= [6 ± 2 sqrt(21 ) ] /8= [3 ± sqrt(21 ) ] /4

So, p= [3 + sqrt(21 ) ] /4 or p= [3 - sqrt(21 ) ] /4

But since u and v are positive (they are cube roots of x and y, which are in first quadrant), p= u v must be positive.

So, p= [3 + sqrt(21 ) ] /4 or p= [3 - sqrt(21 ) ] /4

But sqrt(21 )≈4.583, so 3 - sqrt(21 )≈-1.583, which is negative, so we discard that.

Thus, p= [3 + sqrt(21 ) ] /4

So, p= (3 + sqrt(21 ) ) /4

So, s= (2 sqrt(3)/3 ) p= (2 sqrt(3)/3 )*(3 + sqrt(21 ) ) /4= (2 sqrt(3) (3 + sqrt(21 )) ) /12= ( sqrt(3) (3 + sqrt(21 )) ) /6

So, s= [ sqrt(3)(3 + sqrt(21 )) ] /6

So, s= [ 3 sqrt(3) + sqrt(63 ) ] /6= [ 3 sqrt(3) + 3 sqrt(7 ) ] /6= [ sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ] /2

So, s= (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ) /2

So, from equation 3:

v^3 + sqrt(3) u^3= sqrt(3)/2

But u^3 + v^3= sqrt(3)/2

We can write u^3 + v^3= (u + v )(u^2 - u v + v^2 )

So,

(u + v )(u^2 - u v + v^2 )= sqrt(3)/2

But u + v= s= (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ) /2

And u^2 + v^2=1, so u^2 - u v + v^2= (u^2 + v^2 ) - u v=1 - p

So,

(u + v )(1 - p )= sqrt(3)/2

So,

s (1 - p )= sqrt(3)/2

We have s= (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ) /2, p= (3 + sqrt(21 ) ) /4

So,

( (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ) /2 )(1 - (3 + sqrt(21 ) ) /4 )= sqrt(3)/2

Compute 1 - (3 + sqrt(21 ) ) /4= (4 -3 - sqrt(21 ) ) /4= (1 - sqrt(21 ) ) /4

Thus,

( (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) ) /2 )( (1 - sqrt(21 ) ) /4 )= sqrt(3)/2

Multiply left side:

[ (sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) )(1 - sqrt(21 ) ) ] /8= sqrt(3)/2

Multiply both sides by 8:

(sqrt(3) + sqrt(7 ) )(1 - sqrt(21 ) )=4 sqrt(3 )

Expand left side:

sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(21 )) + sqrt(7)(1 - sqrt(21 ))=4 sqrt(3 )

Compute each term:

sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(21 ))= sqrt(3 ) - sqrt(63 )

sqrt(7)(1 - sqrt(21 ))= sqrt(7 ) - sqrt(147 )

So, left side:

sqrt(3 ) - sqrt(63 ) + sqrt(7 ) - sqrt(147 )

Simplify sqrt(63 )=3 sqrt(7 ), sqrt(147 )=7 sqrt(3 )

So,

sqrt(3 ) -3 sqrt(7 ) + sqrt(7 ) -7 sqrt(3 )

= (sqrt(3 ) -7 sqrt(3 )) + (-3 sqrt(7 ) + sqrt(7 ))

= (-6 sqrt(3 )) + (-2 sqrt(7 ))

So,

-6 sqrt(3 ) -2 sqrt(7 )=4 sqrt(3 )

Bring all terms to left:

-6 sqrt(3 ) -2 sqrt(7 ) -4 sqrt(3 )=0

-10 sqrt(3 ) -2 sqrt(7 )=0

Which is not true.

So, this suggests that our assumption is wrong.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in our approach.

Wait, perhaps the envelope is not the astroid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the envelope.

Wait, actually, the envelope of lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2=1 is indeed the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.

But in our case, the envelope is actually the same astroid.

So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

But when we tried to compute it, we ended up with an inconsistency.

Therefore, perhaps there is only one solution, but we have to solve it differently.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize the astroid.

Parametrize the astroid as x= cos^3(theta ), y= sin^3(theta )

Then, the derivative dy/dx= [ 3 sin^2(theta ) cos(theta ) ] / [ -3 sin^4(theta ) cos^2(theta ) ]= -1/( sin^2(theta ) cos^2(theta ) )

But the slope of AB is -sqrt(3 )

So, set dy/dx= -sqrt(3 )

So,

-1/( sin^2(theta ) cos^2(theta ) )= -sqrt(3 )

So,

1/( sin^2(theta ) cos^2(theta ) )= sqrt(3 )

So,

sin^2(theta ) cos^2(theta )=1/sqrt(3 )

But sin(theta ) cos(theta )= (1/2 ) sin(2 theta )

So,

(1/4 ) sin^2(2 theta )=1/sqrt(3 )

So,

sin^2(2 theta )=4/sqrt(3 )

But 4/sqrt(3 )≈6.928>4, but sin^2(2 theta )<=1, so no solution.

Therefore, no solution.

Wait, that suggests that AB is not tangent to the astroid, which contradicts our previous assumption.

Wait, but this can't be, because we found that when u=1/2, it satisfies the equation.

Wait, but perhaps the parametrization is different.

Wait, the astroid is usually parametrized as x= cos^3(theta ), y= sin^3(theta ), but the envelope is actually the astroid x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a different parametrization.

Wait, regardless, since we have conflicting results, perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing the envelope, we can think of point C as the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB, but that's probably not.

Alternatively, maybe use linear algebra.

Let me consider that for point C on AB, not on any other PQ.

So, for any other PQ in F, the point C does not lie on PQ.

Therefore, for any p≠1/2, q≠sqrt(3)/2, the point C is not on PQ.

So, for any p, q with p^2 + q^2=1, the point C is not on the line PQ.

So, the equation of PQ is y = (-q/p )x + q.

So, for point C=(x, y ), it does not satisfy y = (-q/p )x + q for any p, q with p^2 + q^2=1, except when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, the equation y = (-q/p )x + q has no solution for p, q with p^2 + q^2=1, except when p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2.

So, for point C=(x, y ), the equation y = (-q/p )x + q has no solution in p, q with p^2 + q^2=1, except when p=1/2.

Therefore, we can write:

For all p in (0,1 ), the equation y = (-q/p )x + q has no solution q in (0,1 ).

So, for each p, the line y = (-q/p )x + q does not intersect the unit circle p^2 + q^2=1 at q>0.

But point C is on AB, so y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2.

So, let's write:

For all p in (0,1 ), the equation y= (-q/p )x + q has no solution q>0 such that p^2 + q^2=1.

Therefore, the system:

y= (-q/p )x + q

p^2 + q^2=1

has no solution for q>0, except when p=1/2.

So, substituting y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2 into the first equation:

- sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2= (-q/p )x + q

So,

(- sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2 )= (-q/p )x + q

Rearranged:

( - sqrt(3 ) + q/p )x = q - sqrt(3 )/2

So,

(q/p - sqrt(3 ))x = q - sqrt(3 )/2

So,

q (x/p -1 )= sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 )

So,

q= [ sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 ) ] / (x/p -1 )

But p^2 + q^2=1.

Substitute q:

p^2 + [ sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 ) / (x/p -1 ) ]^2=1

But this is a complicated equation.

Alternatively, perhaps solve for p.

Let me denote p as variable.

So,

From above:

q= [ sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 ) ] / (x/p -1 )

So,

q= sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 ) / (x/p -1 )

So,

q= sqrt(3 ) (x -1/2 ) / ( (x - p ) /p )= sqrt(3 ) p (x -1/2 ) / (x - p )

So,

q= sqrt(3 ) p (x -1/2 ) / (x - p )

But p^2 + q^2=1.

So,

p^2 + [ sqrt(3 ) p (x -1/2 ) / (x - p ) ]^2=1

So,

p^2 + 3 p^2 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - p )^2=1

Factor p^2:

p^2 [ 1 + 3 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - p )^2 ]=1

So,

p^2=1 / [ 1 + 3 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - p )^2 ]

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, let me set t=p.

So, t in (0,1 )

Then,

q= sqrt(3 ) t (x -1/2 ) / (x - t )

So,

t^2 + [ sqrt(3 ) t (x -1/2 ) / (x - t ) ]^2=1

So,

t^2 + 3 t^2 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - t )^2=1

Factor t^2:

t^2 [ 1 + 3 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - t )^2 ]=1

So,

t^2=1 / [ 1 + 3 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - t )^2 ]

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for point C=(x, y ) on AB, the equation above has no solution for t in (0,1 )

So, for all t in (0,1 ), the equation:

t^2 + 3 t^2 (x -1/2 )^2 / (x - t )^2=1

has no solution.

Therefore, the discriminant is negative.

But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of duality.

Since all lines PQ in F are tangent to the envelope, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Therefore, if we can find the point of tangency, that is point C.

But since we couldn't compute it correctly before, perhaps try to use another method.

Wait, let's use the condition that AB is tangent to the envelope.

So, the condition for a line to be tangent to a curve is that the system of equations has exactly one solution, and the derivatives match.

So, for the astroid x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1 and line y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2.

So, substitute y into the astroid:

x^(2/3 ) + ( -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2 )^(2/3 )=1

Let me compute:

Let me denote z= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2

So,

x^(2/3 ) + z^(2/3 )=1

But z= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2

So,

x^(2/3 ) + ( -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2 )^(2/3 )=1

Let me compute ( -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2 )^(2/3 )

= [ sqrt(3 )( -x +1/2 ) ]^(2/3 )

= (sqrt(3 ))^(2/3 ) ( -x +1/2 )^(2/3 )

= 3^(1/3 ) ( -x +1/2 )^(2/3 )

So,

x^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 ) ( -x +1/2 )^(2/3 )=1

Let me set t= x.

So,

t^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 ) ( -t +1/2 )^(2/3 )=1

This equation must hold for some t in (0,1 )

Let me denote a=3^(1/3 ), b=1/2.

So,

t^(2/3 ) +a ( -t +b )^(2/3 )=1

Let me let u= t^(1/3 ), v= (-t +b )^(1/3 )

Then,

u^2 +a (v )^2=1

But also, u^3 + (-t +b )= t + (-t +b )=b=1/2

Wait, no:

Wait, u= t^(1/3 ), so t= u^3.

Similarly, (-t +b )= (-u^3 +1/2 )

So, v= ( -u^3 +1/2 )^(1/3 )

So,

u^2 +a v^2=1

But also, u^3 + (-u^3 +1/2 )=1/2

So,

u^3 -u^3 +1/2=1/2, which is trivial.

So, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me set s= t.

Then,

s^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 ) ( -s +1/2 )^(2/3 )=1

Let me compute this numerically.

Let me assume that s is around 1/2.

Let me try s=1/2.

Compute:

(1/2 )^(2/3 )≈0.63

3^(1/3 )( -1/2 +1/2 )^(2/3 )=0

So, total≈0.63 <1. Not equal.

s=0.7:

(0.7 )^(2/3 )≈0.7^0.666≈0.7^0.666≈0.7^(2/3 )≈approx 0.7^(0.666 )≈0.7^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.7 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-0.3567 ) )≈exp(-0.2378 )≈0.788

Similarly, (-0.7 +0.5 )= -0.2, so ( -0.2 )^(2/3 )= (0.2 )^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.2 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-1.609 ) )≈exp(-1.072 )≈0.34

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442

So, 3^(1/3 )*0.34≈1.442*0.34≈0.49

So, total≈0.788 +0.49≈1.278>1.

So, somewhere between s=0.5 and s=0.7.

Wait, but we can use Newton-Raphson method.

Let me define f(s )= s^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 ) ( -s +1/2 )^(2/3 ) -1

We need to find s in (0,1 ) such that f(s )=0.

Compute f(0.5 )≈0.63 +0 -1≈-0.37

f(0.7 )≈0.788 +0.49 -1≈0.278

f(0.6 ):

s=0.6

s^(2/3 )≈0.6^0.666≈approx 0.6^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.6 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-0.510 ) )≈exp(-0.34 )≈0.711

(-0.6 +0.5 )^(-2/3 )= (-0.1 )^(2/3 )=0.1^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.1 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-2.302 ) )≈exp(-1.535 )≈0.217

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.312

So, f(0.6 )≈0.711 +0.312 -1≈-0.977

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps better to compute more accurately.

Wait, s=0.6:

s^(2/3 )= (0.6 )^(2/3 )≈approx?

Compute 0.6^(1/3 )≈0.6^(0.333 )≈0.855

So, 0.855^2≈0.731

Similarly, (-0.6 +0.5 )= -0.1

(-0.1 )^(2/3 )= [ (-0.1 )^(1/3 ) ]^2≈( -0.464 )^2≈0.215

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.215*1.442≈0.309

So, f(0.6 )≈0.731 +0.309 -1≈0.04

So, f(0.6 )≈0.04

Similarly, f(0.55 ):

s=0.55

s^(2/3 )≈(0.55 )^(2/3 )≈approx?

0.55^(1/3 )≈0.55^0.333≈0.82

0.82^2≈0.672

(-0.55 +0.5 )= -0.05

(-0.05 )^(2/3 )≈( -0.05 )^(0.666 )≈approx 0.05^(0.666 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.05 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-3.0 ) )≈exp(-2.0 )≈0.135

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.135*1.442≈0.194

So, f(0.55 )≈0.672 +0.194 -1≈-0.134

So, f(0.55 )≈-0.134, f(0.6 )≈0.04

So, root between 0.55 and 0.6.

Compute f(0.575 ):

s=0.575

s^(2/3 )≈(0.575 )^(2/3 )

Compute 0.575^(1/3 )≈approx?

Let me compute 0.575^(1/3 ).

We know that 0.8^3=0.512, 0.82^3≈0.82*0.82=0.6724, 0.6724*0.82≈0.551

So, 0.82^3≈0.551, which is less than 0.575.

0.83^3=0.571, which is close to 0.575.

So, 0.83^3≈0.571, 0.575-0.571=0.004.

So, approximate 0.575^(1/3 )≈0.83 + (0.004 )/(3*(0.83 )^2 )≈0.83 +0.004/(3*0.69 )≈0.83 +0.004/2.07≈0.830 +0.0019≈0.8319

So, 0.8319^2≈approx 0.8319^2≈0.691

Similarly, (-0.575 +0.5 )= -0.075

(-0.075 )^(2/3 )= [ (-0.075 )^(1/3 ) ]^2≈( -0.422 )^2≈0.178

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.178*1.442≈0.256

So, f(0.575 )≈0.691 +0.256 -1≈-0.053

So, f(0.575 )≈-0.053

Compute f(0.58 ):

s=0.58

s^(2/3 )≈approx?

Compute 0.58^(1/3 ). 0.8^3=0.512, 0.82^3≈0.551, 0.83^3≈0.571, 0.84^3≈0.592

So, 0.58 is between 0.83 and0.84.

Compute 0.83^3=0.571, 0.571 to 0.58 is 0.009.

So, 0.83 + delta, delta≈0.009/(3*(0.83 )^2 )≈0.009/(3*0.69 )≈0.009/2.07≈0.0043.

So, approx 0.834.

So, 0.834^2≈0.834*0.834≈0.695

Similarly, (-0.58 +0.5 )= -0.08

(-0.08 )^(2/3 )= [ (-0.08 )^(1/3 ) ]^2≈( -0.43 )^2≈0.1849

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.1849*1.442≈0.266

So, f(0.58 )≈0.695 +0.266 -1≈0.961 -1≈-0.039

Still negative.

Wait, f(0.575 )≈-0.053, f(0.58 )≈-0.039

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, s=0.575:

s^(2/3 )≈0.691

(-s +0.5 )= -0.075

(-0.075 )^(2/3 )≈0.178

3^(1/3 )*0.178≈0.256

f(s )≈0.691 +0.256 -1≈-0.053

Similarly, s=0.59:

s^(2/3 )≈approx?

0.59^(1/3 )≈approx 0.836

0.836^2≈0.699

(-0.59 +0.5 )= -0.09

(-0.09 )^(2/3 )≈(0.09 )^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.09 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-2.197 ) )≈exp(-1.47 )≈0.23

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.23*1.442≈0.33

So, f(0.59 )≈0.699 +0.33 -1≈0.029

So, f(0.59 )≈0.029

So, between s=0.575 and s=0.59, f(s ) crosses zero.

Use linear approximation.

Between s=0.575, f=-0.053

s=0.59, f=0.029

So, total change: 0.029 - (-0.053 )=0.082 over delta_s=0.015

Need to find delta_s where f=0.

From s=0.575, need delta_s such that:

-0.053 + (0.082 /0.015 ) delta_s=0

So, delta_s= (0.053 /0.082 )*0.015≈(0.053 /0.082 )*0.015≈0.0065

So, s≈0.575 +0.0065≈0.5815

So, approximate root at s≈0.5815

Thus, x≈0.5815

So, y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2≈-1.732*0.5815 +0.866≈-1.005 +0.866≈-0.139

But y is negative, which is impossible because C is in the first quadrant.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, because the astroid is in the first quadrant, so point C is in the first quadrant, so y must be positive.

But when I computed f(s ), I got negative y.

Wait, probably because of an error in substitution.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, when we substituted the line into the astroid equation, we had:

x^(2/3 ) + y^(2/3 )=1

But when solving numerically, I set y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2, but y must be positive.

So, for point C on AB in the first quadrant, y must be positive.

So, when solving for s, s must be such that y>0.

So, y= -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2>0

Thus,

 -sqrt(3 )x + sqrt(3 )/2>0

=> sqrt(3 )( -x +1/2 )>0

=> -x +1/2>0

=>x<1/2

So, x<1/2.

Therefore, in our numerical computation, s must be less than 0.5.

So, try s=0.45:

Compute f(s )=0.45^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 )*(-0.45 +0.5 )^(2/3 ) -1

=0.45^(2/3 ) +3^(1/3 )*(0.05 )^(2/3 ) -1

Compute 0.45^(2/3 )≈approx.

0.45^(1/3 )≈0.764

0.764^2≈0.583

3^(1/3 )≈1.442

(0.05 )^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.05 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-3.0 ) )≈exp(-2.0 )≈0.135

Multiply by 3^(1/3 ):≈1.442*0.135≈0.194

So, f(0.45 )≈0.583 +0.194 -1≈-0.223

f(0.45 )≈-0.223

s=0.475:

0.475^(2/3 )≈approx.

0.475^(1/3 )≈0.78

0.78^2≈0.608

(-0.475 +0.5 )=0.025

(0.025 )^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.025 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-3.7 ) )≈exp(-2.47 )≈0.083

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.119

So, f(0.475 )≈0.608 +0.119 -1≈-0.273

Still negative.

s=0.49:

0.49^(2/3 )≈approx.

0.49^(1/3 )≈0.78

0.78^2≈0.608

(-0.49 +0.5 )=0.01

(0.01 )^(2/3 )≈exp( (2/3 ) ln0.01 )≈exp( (2/3 )*(-4.605 ) )≈exp(-3.07 )≈0.047

Multiply by 3^(1/3 )≈1.442:≈0.047*1.442≈0.068

So, f(0.49 )≈0.608 +0.068 -1≈-0.324

Still negative.

Wait, this suggests that f(s ) is always negative for x<1/2.

Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, perhaps the astroid is not the envelope.

Wait, actually, in the first quadrant, the astroid is a convex curve, but perhaps the envelope is different.

Wait, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle.

Wait, but each line PQ is a secant of the unit circle, not a tangent.

So, the envelope cannot be the unit circle.

Wait, maybe the envelope is a different curve.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: Let me consider that the envelope is the set of points where each line PQ is tangent to the envelope.

But for each line PQ, which is a secant of the unit circle, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent to the envelope.

But as each PQ is a secant, the envelope is not the unit circle.

Wait, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle.

Wait, but for each PQ, which is a secant, the envelope is the unit circle.

But that can't be, because the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each line PQ.

But each PQ is a secant, not a tangent.

Wait, maybe the envelope is the unit circle, but each PQ is a secant.

But the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each line PQ, but each PQ is a secant of the unit circle.

Therefore, the envelope is a different curve.

Wait, perhaps it's a cardioid or something else.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is the midpoint of AB.

But let me check.

Midpoint of AB is ( (1/2 +0 )/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2 )/2 )=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4 )

Check if this point is on any other PQ.

So, for the midpoint (1/4, sqrt(3)/4 ), check if it lies on any PQ.

For PQ, the equation is y = (-q/p )x + q.

So, sqrt(3)/4 = (-q/p )(1/4 ) + q

Multiply both sides by 4:

sqrt(3 )= -q/p +4 q

So,

sqrt(3 )= q (4 -1/p )

But p^2 + q^2=1.

So,

q= sqrt(1 -p^2 )

So,

sqrt(3 )= sqrt(1 -p^2 ) (4 -1/p )

Let me set t=p.

So,

sqrt(3 )= sqrt(1 -t^2 ) (4 -1/t )

Let me compute:

sqrt(1 -t^2 ) (4 -1/t )=sqrt(3 )

Square both sides:

(1 -t^2 )(4 -1/t )^2=3

Compute:

(1 -t^2 )(16 -8/t +1/t^2 )=3

Expand:

16(1 -t^2 ) -8(1 -t^2 )/t + (1 -t^2 )/t^2=3

This is a complicated equation.

But let me test t=1/2.

t=1/2:

Left side:

(1 -1/4 )(16 -8/(1/2 ) +1/(1/4 ) )= (3/4 )(16 -16 +4 )= (3/4 )(4 )=3

Which equals right side=3.

So, t=1/2 is a solution.

Therefore, the midpoint (1/4, sqrt(3)/4 ) lies on PQ when p=1/2, which is AB.

Therefore, the midpoint is on AB, but also on no other PQ.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, there exists a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any other segment from F.

So, if the midpoint is such a point, then OC^2= (1/4 )^2 + (sqrt(3)/4 )^2=1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4.

So, OC^2=1/4, so p=1, q=4, p and q coprime? Wait, 1 and 4 are coprime.

So, p=1, q=4, so p + q=5.

But wait, is the midpoint the only point?

Wait, but when we tried earlier to find the envelope, we found another point, but perhaps it's the same.

But let me verify.

If the midpoint is the only point on AB that does not lie on any other PQ, then OC^2=1/4, so p + q=1 +4=5.

But wait, let me confirm.

Suppose point C is the midpoint, (1/4, sqrt(3)/4 )

Then, for any p≠1/2, does the line PQ pass through C?

So, for p≠1/2, does the equation sqrt(3)/4 = (-q/p )(1/4 ) + q hold?

Which is equivalent to sqrt(3 )= -q/p +4 q.

But earlier, we saw that t=1/2 is a solution, so p=1/2 is the only solution.

Therefore, the midpoint is the only point on AB that does not lie on any other PQ.

Therefore, OC^2= (1/4 )^2 + (sqrt(3)/4 )^2=1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4.

So, p=1, q=4, so p + q=5.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
</think>

Given points \( O(0,0) \), \( A(\frac{1}{2}, 0) \), and \( B(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \), we need to find a point \( C \) on segment \( \overline{AB} \) that does not belong to any other segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) of unit length segments \( \overline{PQ} \) with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis.

1. **Parametrize Segment \( AB \)**:
   - The coordinates of a point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) can be written as:
     \[
     x = \frac{1}{2}(1 - t), \quad y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t
     \]
   where \( t \) varies from 0 to 1.

2. **Equation of Line \( PQ \)**:
   - For any \( P(p, 0) \) and \( Q(0, q) \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \), the line \( PQ \) is:
     \[
     y = -\frac{q}{p}x + q
     \]

3. **Condition for Point \( C \)**:
   - For point \( C \) to not lie on any other segment \( \overline{PQ} \), the equation of the line \( PQ \) must not pass through \( C \) for any \( p \) and \( q \) other than when \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( q = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

4. **Midpoint of \( AB \)**:
   - The midpoint of \( AB \) is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)
     \]
   - This midpoint is the point \( C \) that does not lie on any other segment \( \overline{PQ} \) from \( \mathcal{F} \).

5. **Compute \( OC^2 \)**:
   - The coordinates of \( C \) are \( \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \).
   - Therefore, \( OC^2 \) is:
     \[
     OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Expressing \( OC^2 \) as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, we get \( p = 1 \) and \( q = 4 \).

6. **Final Result**:
   - The sum of \( p \) and \( q \) is \( 1 + 4 = 5 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
