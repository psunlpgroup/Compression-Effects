Okay, let's try to figure out if Tom is an Eastern wild turkey based on the given premises. So, first, I need to list out all the types of wild turkeys mentioned: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, Rio Grande, and Ocellated. That's six types in total.

Now, the premises say that Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey. So, Tom ≠ Eastern. Similarly, Tom is not an Osceola, so Tom ≠ Osceola. He's also not a Gould’s, so Tom ≠ Gould’s. Then, it says Tom is neither a Merriam’s nor a Rio Grande, which means Tom is not Merriam’s and Tom is not Rio Grande. So, from this, we can eliminate those four types: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande.

Wait, but there are six types in total. So, the only types left that Tom could be are Ocellated. Because we've eliminated the other five, and Tom is a wild turkey, so he must be one of these six. Therefore, Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey.

But the conclusion says Tom is an Eastern wild turkey, which is one of the types we already eliminated. So, that can't be right. Therefore, the conclusion is false because Tom is actually an Ocellated wild turkey, not an Eastern one.

**Answer:** False.

**Explanation:** 

From the premises, Tom is excluded from five types of wild turkeys: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande. Since there are only six types of wild turkeys and Tom is a wild turkey, the only possible type left is Ocellated. Therefore, the conclusion that Tom is an Eastern wild turkey is incorrect.
