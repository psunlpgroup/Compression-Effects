To determine the possible times Samantha could have gone to the swimming pool, let's analyze the information provided.

First, Samantha wakes up at 5 am. From 5 am to 8 am, Thomas sees her walking in the garden. So, she's not at the swimming pool during this time.

Next, from 9 am to 10 am, David sees her stretching at a yoga studio. Again, she's not at the swimming pool.

From 10 am to 11 am, Nancy sees her buying a bike at a bike shop. She's still not at the swimming pool.

Then, from 11 am to 3 pm, Betty sees her working out at the gym. Still, she's not at the swimming pool.

Finally, from 3 pm to 5 pm, John sees her buying cookies at a bakery. She's not at the swimming pool during this time either.

The swimming pool is closed after 5 pm, which means she couldn't have gone there after that time.

Considering all these intervals, there's no time when Samantha is free to go to the swimming pool. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the information provided or perhaps she didn't go to the swimming pool at all during the observed period.

   - **Samantha was not at the swimming pool.**

2. **9 AM - 10 AM:**

   - **Samantha was not at the swimming pool.**

3. **10 AM - 11 AM:**  
   - **Nancy saw Samantha buying a bike at the bike shop.**  
   - **Samantha was not at the swimming pool.**

4. **11 AM - 3 PM:**  
   - **Betty saw Samantha working out at the gym.**  
   - **Samantha was not at the swimming pool.**

5. **3 PM - 5 PM:**  
   - **John saw Samantha buying cookies at a bakery.**  
   - **Samantha was not at the swimming pool.**

6. **After 5 PM:**

   - **Samantha could not have gone to the swimming pool.**

**Conclusion:**  
Based on the timeline provided, there is no time when Samantha was free to go to the swimming pool. The swimming pool was also closed after 5 PM, which means she couldn't have gone there after that time.

Therefore, **Samantha did not go to the swimming pool during the observed period.**
