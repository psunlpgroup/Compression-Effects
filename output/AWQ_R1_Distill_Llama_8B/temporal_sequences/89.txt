Alright, let's try to figure out when James could have gone to the swimming pool. I'll go through the information step by step.

First, James woke up at 5am. So he was up and about starting from 5am.

Then, Ashley saw James sitting on a rooftop from 7am to 9am. That means James was on the rooftop during that time.

Next, Hannah saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 7pm. So, from 9am until 7pm, James was taking photos.

William saw James buying cookies at a bakery from 7pm to 8pm. So, right after Hannah saw him taking photos, he went to buy cookies.

Linda saw James waiting at the train station from 8pm to 10pm. So, after buying cookies, he was waiting at the train station.

The swimming pool was closed after 10pm. So, James couldn't have gone to the pool after 10pm because it was closed.

Now, let's piece together the timeline:

- **5am**: James wakes up.
- **7am - 9am**: James is on the rooftop (as seen by Ashley).
- **9am - 7pm**: James is taking photos near the Eiffel Tower (as seen by Hannah).
- **7pm - 8pm**: James buys cookies (as seen by William).
- **8pm - 10pm**: James is waiting at the train station (as seen by Linda).

The swimming pool is only open until 10pm, and after that, it's closed. So, James would have had to go to the pool before 10pm.

Looking at the times when James is not seen by anyone else:

- Between **5am and 7am**: James was awake but not spotted by anyone else.
- Between **7am and 9am**: He was on the rooftop (seen by Ashley).
- Between **9am and 7pm**: He was taking photos (seen by Hannah).
- Between **7pm and 8pm**: He was buying cookies (seen by William).
- Between **8pm and 10pm**: He was at the train station (seen by Linda).

So, the only time James wasn't being seen by anyone else is between **5am and 7am**. That's the earliest he could have gone to the pool before anyone saw him elsewhere.

Also, after 10pm, the pool is closed, so he couldn't have gone then.

Therefore, the possible time James could have gone to the swimming pool is between **5am and 7am**.
</think>

The swimming pool was closed after 10pm, so James must have gone to the pool before 10pm. The only time he wasn't spotted by anyone else is between 5am and 7am.

**Answer:** (C) 5am to 7am
