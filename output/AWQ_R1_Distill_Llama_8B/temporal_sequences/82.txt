Let's analyze the timeline step by step:

1. **Woke up at 6am.**
   - Kimberly starts her day at 6am.

2. **William saw Kimberly buying a phone from 6am to 8am.**
   - During this time, Kimberly is at the electronics store.

3. **Jason saw Kimberly waiting at the train station from 8am to 9am.**
   - At 8am, Kimberly is transitioning from the electronics store to the train station.

4. **Tiffany saw Kimberly walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 9am to 1pm.**
   - At 9am, Kimberly is at the train station, and by 1pm, she's walking towards the Statue of Liberty.

5. **Linda saw Kimberly stretching at a yoga studio from 3pm to 8pm.**
   - This suggests that after arriving at the Statue of Liberty, Kimberly went to the yoga studio.

6. **Sean saw Kimberly driving to the water park from 8pm to 9pm.**
   - At 8pm, Kimberly is leaving the yoga studio to drive to the water park.

7. **Football field was closed after 9pm.**
   - Therefore, Kimberly cannot have gone to the football field after 9pm.

From the timeline, the only overlapping time when Kimberly could have gone to the football field is between **8pm to 9pm**, as this is when Sean saw her driving to the water park, and the football field was still open during this period.

However, since the football field was closed after 9pm, and Sean saw her driving to the water park at 9pm, it's likely that she didn't have time to go to the football field during that specific window.

But based on the information provided, the only possible time when she could have gone is between **8am to 9am**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) 8am to 9am**.

**Answer:** (A)
