To determine the possible times James could have gone to the restaurant, let's analyze the information provided.

First, James woke up at **12pm**. This is the earliest possible time he could have left the house.

Next, Elizabeth saw James at the yoga studio from **3pm to 4pm**. This means James was likely at the yoga studio during this timeframe.

Then, Michael saw James at the electronic store from **4pm to 7pm**. This suggests James was occupied at the store during this time.

Mary saw James working at the office from **7pm to 9pm**. This indicates he was busy at the office during this period.

Finally, Nancy saw James working out at the gym from **9pm to 10pm**. This means he was at the gym during this time.

The restaurant was closed after **10pm**, so James could not have gone to the restaurant after this time.

Considering all these activities, the only time James was free before the restaurant closed is **from 3pm to 4pm**. This is when he was at the yoga studio, but since he was seen there, he could have left to go to the restaurant during this time.

Therefore, the possible time James could have gone to the restaurant is **3pm to 4pm**.
