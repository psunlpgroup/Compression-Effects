Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion that Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the premise states that Robert Lewandowski is a striker. I know that in soccer, a striker is a type of forward player who typically plays as a center forward or just behind the striker in the attack. So, that part makes sense.

Next, it mentions that strikers are soccer players. That's a given. All strikers are soccer players, but not all soccer players are strikers. But in this case, the premise is about Robert Lewandowski specifically, so that's clear.

Then, the premise says that Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen. I remember that Bayern Munchen is a prominent German football club, known for having some of the best players in the world, including Lewandowski. However, I also recall that Lewandowski did leave Bayern Munchen in the past, moving to another club, which I think was Barcelona. So, he left Bayern, which aligns with the premise.

The next part is an inference: If a player leaves a team, they no longer play for that team. This seems logical. If someone leaves a team, they don't play for that team anymore. So, if Lewandowski left Bayern, he wouldn't play for them anymore.

Putting this all together, the premise tells us that Lewandowski is a striker (a soccer player) and that he left Bayern Munchen. Based on the inference, leaving a team means he doesn't play for them anymore. So, the conclusion that he plays for Bayern Munchen would be false because he left them.

Wait, but is there any possibility that he could return? The premise doesn't mention anything about returning, so we have to go with what's given. The fact that he left implies he's no longer with Bayern unless stated otherwise. Therefore, the conclusion that he plays for Bayern is incorrect based on the premise provided.

I don't see any uncertainties here because the premise clearly states he left, and the inference is that leaving means he's no longer with the team. So, the conclusion is false.

The conclusion that Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen is based on the premise that he left the team. The inference is that leaving a team means he no longer plays for it. Since the premise states he left, the conclusion is false.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
