Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion that Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out the premises again to make sure I have them right:

1. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
2. Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
3. All animal lovers are nice to animals.
4. All pet owners love animals.
5. Tom is a pet owner.

And the conclusion is: Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals.

Alright, so starting with premise 1: No one who is nice to animals is also mean to animals. This sounds like a universal statement, meaning if someone is nice to animals, they can't be mean to them. So, niceness to animals and meanness to animals are mutually exclusive traits.

Premise 2: Some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, there is at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals. This doesn't mean all grumpy people are mean to animals, just some.

Premise 3: All animal lovers are nice to animals. So, if someone is an animal lover, they are nice to animals. This is a broader category than just being nice to animals; it's more specific, perhaps, but it's given as a fact.

Premise 4: All pet owners love animals. So, if someone owns a pet, they love animals. This seems related to premise 3 because being a pet owner implies a level of affection for animals.

Premise 5: Tom is a pet owner. So, Tom is in the category of people who love animals, based on premise 4.

Now, the conclusion is that Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals. So, we need to see if Tom can be grumpy and mean to animals, or if that's impossible based on the premises.

Let me try to map this out.

From premise 1: Nice to animals → not mean to animals.

From premise 3: Animal lover → nice to animals. Since all animal lovers are nice to animals, and from premise 1, being nice to animals means not being mean to animals. Therefore, animal lovers cannot be mean to animals.

From premise 4: Pet owner → loves animals. So, as a pet owner, Tom is an animal lover, which means he's nice to animals (from premise 3) and thus, not mean to animals (from premise 1).

Now, premise 2 says some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, being grumpy doesn't necessarily mean you're mean to animals, but some grumpy people are. But the key here is that if someone is nice to animals, they can't be mean to animals. So, if Tom is a pet owner, he's nice to animals, so he can't be mean to animals.

But the conclusion is about Tom not being both grumpy and mean to animals. So, can Tom be grumpy and mean to animals? Well, from premise 2, some grumpy people are mean to animals, but it doesn't say that all grumpy people are. So, it's possible that some grumpy people are mean to animals, but it's also possible that some grumpy people are not.

However, since Tom is a pet owner, he is nice to animals, so he can't be mean to animals. Therefore, even if he is grumpy, he can't be mean to animals. So, the combination of being grumpy and mean to animals is impossible for Tom.

Wait, but does being nice to animals necessarily mean you can't be grumpy? Or is grumpiness unrelated? The premises don't link grumpiness directly to meanness or niceness to animals, except that some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, grumpiness can coexist with meanness, but not with niceness.

Since Tom is nice to animals, he can't be mean to animals. Therefore, he can't be both grumpy and mean to animals because he's not mean to animals at all. So, the conclusion holds.

Alternatively, suppose Tom is grumpy. Then, from premise 2, it's possible he's mean to animals. But since Tom is a pet owner, he's nice to animals, so he can't be mean to animals. Therefore, he can't be both grumpy and mean to animals because he's not mean to animals. So, the conclusion that Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals is true.

I think that makes sense. So, the conclusion is true.
</think>

The conclusion that Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals is true.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 1:** No one who is nice to animals is mean to animals. This means niceness and meanness to animals are mutually exclusive.

2. **Premise 3:** All animal lovers are nice to animals. Therefore, animal lovers cannot be mean to animals.

3. **Premise 4:** All pet owners love animals. Thus, pet owners are a subset of animal lovers and are therefore nice to animals, not mean to animals.

4. **Premise 5:** Tom is a pet owner. Hence, Tom is an animal lover and is nice to animals, making him not mean to animals.

5. **Premise 2:** Some grumpy people are mean to animals. This means grumpy people can be mean to animals, but not necessarily all.

6. **Conclusion:** Since Tom is not mean to animals (due to being a pet owner), he cannot be both grumpy and mean to animals. Therefore, the conclusion is true.

**Answer:** True
