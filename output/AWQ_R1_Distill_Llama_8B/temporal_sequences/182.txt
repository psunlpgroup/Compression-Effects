Alright, let's try to figure out when Jason could have gone to the gas station. So, Jason wakes up at 5am. Then, Sean sees him walking in the garden from 5am to 8am. Okay, so that's the first few hours after he wakes up.

Next, David sees Jason buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 2pm. Hmm, so that's a significant chunk of time in the morning and early afternoon. It looks like Jason was out and about during this time.

Then, Jennifer sees Jason driving to the water park from 2pm to 5pm. So, after lunch, he's heading to the water park. That means he's probably not at the gas station during this time because he's driving to the water park instead.

Moving on, Lisa sees Jason watching a movie at the theater from 6pm to 7pm. So, in the late afternoon, he's at the theater. That rules out the gas station during this time.

Finally, Mary sees Jason buying cookies at a bakery from 7pm to 10pm. So, after the movie, he's at the bakery. Since the gas station is closed after 10pm, he wouldn't have gone there after 10pm either.

Now, let's look at the gas station's operating hours. It's closed after 10pm, so the latest he could have gone is before 10pm.

Putting it all together, Jason was seen by Sean from 5am to 8am, then by David from 8am to 2pm, then by Jennifer from 2pm to 5pm, followed by Lisa from 6pm to 7pm, and finally by Mary from 7pm to 10pm.

So, when could he have gone to the gas station? Well, the gas station was open from 5am to 10pm, but he was occupied with other activities during specific times. The times when he wasn't seen by anyone else might be when he could have gone to the gas station.

Looking at the gaps:

- From 5pm to 6pm: He was at the water park with Jennifer from 2pm to 5pm, so he might have been at the gas station right when he was free.

- From 7pm to 10pm: He was buying cookies at the bakery with Mary, so he wouldn't have gone to the gas station then.

So, the only time he could have gone is between 5pm to 6pm.

Wait, but let's double-check. Between 5pm and 6pm, was he free? He was at the water park until 5pm, and then at the theater from 6pm to 7pm. So, yeah, between 5pm to 6pm, he was free to go to the gas station.

That makes sense. So, the correct time would be 5pm to 6pm, which is option A.

The correct time Jason could have gone to the gas station is between 5pm to 6pm.

**Answer: (A) 5pm to 6pm**
