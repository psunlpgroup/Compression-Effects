Alright, let's try to figure out when James could have gone to the swimming pool. I'll start by listing all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, James woke up at 10am. That's a good starting point. So, James was at least awake by 10am.

Next, Richard saw James taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 11am. So, Richard saw James during that time frame. That means James was probably still around the Eiffel Tower during 10am to 11am.

Then, Leslie saw James waiting at the airport from 12pm to 2pm. So, that's a different location, the airport, and a longer time frame. So, James was at the airport from 12pm to 2pm.

Ashley saw James sitting on a rooftop from 2pm to 5pm. So, that's another location, a rooftop, and a longer duration. So, James was there from 2pm to 5pm.

Thomas saw James playing tennis at the tennis court from 5pm to 6pm. So, that's a specific activity at a specific place, the tennis court, from 5pm to 6pm.

Jennifer saw James walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm. So, that's another location, the Statue of Liberty, and a time frame from 6pm to 7pm.

The swimming pool was closed after 7pm, so James couldn't have gone to the swimming pool after 7pm.

Now, let's piece this together.

James was at the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 11am. Then, he was at the airport from 12pm to 2pm. Then, on the rooftop from 2pm to 5pm. Then, playing tennis from 5pm to 6pm. Finally, walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm.

So, when could he have gone to the swimming pool? He was at the swimming pool before 7pm because the pool was closed after 7pm. So, he must have gone before 7pm.

Looking at his schedule:

- 10am to 11am: Eiffel Tower
- 12pm to 2pm: Airport
- 2pm to 5pm: Rooftop
- 5pm to 6pm: Tennis court
- 6pm to 7pm: Statue of Liberty

So, between these times, when was he free? Let's check:

Between 11am and 12pm, he was at the Eiffel Tower until 11am, and then Richard saw him there until 11am. So, after 11am, he went to the airport, which starts at 12pm. So, between 11am and 12pm, he was moving from the Eiffel Tower to the airport.

Wait, but Richard saw him from 10am to 11am, so he was at the Eiffel Tower during that time. Then, after 11am, he went to the airport, which starts at 12pm. So, there's a 1-hour gap between 11am and 12pm when he was not at the Eiffel Tower or the airport yet.

Similarly, between 2pm and 5pm, he was on the rooftop. So, that's a 3-hour window. Then, from 5pm to 6pm, he was playing tennis. So, the times when he was free are:

- 11am to 12pm
- 7pm onwards, but the pool was closed after 7pm, so he couldn't have gone then.

Wait, but he was at the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm, so he was busy then. So, the only free time he had was between 11am to 12pm and possibly after 5pm, but the pool was closed after 7pm.

But he was at the tennis court from 5pm to 6pm, and then at the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm. So, after 7pm, he couldn't have gone to the pool because it was closed.

So, the only possible time he could have gone to the pool is between 11am to 12pm.

But let's check the options:

(A) 10am to 11am

But he was at the Eiffel Tower during that time, so he couldn't have gone to the pool then.

(B) 12pm to 2pm

He was at the airport then, so no.

(C) 11am to 12pm

That's a possible time when he wasn't at the Eiffel Tower or the airport yet.

(D) 2pm to 5pm

He was on the rooftop during that time, so no.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 11am to 12pm.
</think>

The swimming pool was closed after 7pm, so James couldn't have gone to the pool after that time. The only free time James had was between 11am to 12pm before he went to the airport.

**Answer: (C) 11am to 12pm**
