Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Ashley could have gone to the amusement park. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it all fits together.

First, Ashley woke up at 7am. That's a good starting point. Then, we have different people seeing Ashley at different places at different times:

1. **Kimberly** saw Ashley driving to the water park from 7am to 8am.
2. **Lisa** saw Ashley buying clothes at the mall from 8am to 10am.
3. **Hannah** saw Ashley taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 3pm.
4. **Jessica** saw Ashley walking in the garden from 3pm to 4pm.
5. **William** saw Ashley getting a coffee at the cafe from 4pm to 7pm.

Additionally, the amusement park was closed after 9pm, which means the latest Ashley could have gone to the amusement park is before 9pm.

Now, let's break it down step by step:

- **From 7am to 8am**: Ashley was driving to the water park according to Kimberly. So, if Ashley was at the water park during this time, she would have been there between 7am and 8am. But wait, the question is about the amusement park, not the water park. So, this time doesn't apply to the amusement park.

- **From 8am to 10am**: Lisa saw Ashley buying clothes at the mall. So, Ashley was at the mall during this time. The amusement park times would have to be outside of this period.

- **From 10am to 3pm**: Hannah saw Ashley taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. So, Ashley was taking photos during this time. The amusement park is a different place, so this doesn't interfere with the park's operating hours.

- **From 3pm to 4pm**: Jessica saw Ashley walking in the garden. So, Ashley was in the garden during this time. Again, not related to the amusement park.

- **From 4pm to 7pm**: William saw Ashley getting a coffee at the cafe. So, Ashley was at the cafe during this time. The amusement park could potentially be open during this window, depending on its operating hours.

- **After 9pm**: The amusement park was closed after 9pm. So, Ashley couldn't have gone to the amusement park after 9pm.

Putting this all together, the only time when Ashley wasn't seen at any of these other places is between 7pm and 9pm. Since the amusement park was open until 9pm, and there's no information indicating she was elsewhere during this time, Ashley could have gone to the amusement park between 7pm and 9pm.

So, the correct answer is (D) 7pm to 9pm.
