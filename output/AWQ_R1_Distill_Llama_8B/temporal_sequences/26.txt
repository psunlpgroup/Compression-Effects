Okay, so I need to figure out between what times David could have gone to the gas station. Let's start by laying out all the information given.

First, David woke up at 7am. That's the earliest time we know.

Then, Michael saw David waiting at the train station from 7am to 12pm. So, Michael saw him between 7am and noon.

Next, Thomas saw David sitting on a rooftop from 12pm to 2pm. So, Thomas saw him between noon and 2pm.

Tiffany saw David getting a coffee at the cafe from 2pm to 3pm. So, Tiffany saw him between 2pm and 3pm.

James saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 5pm. So, James saw him between 3pm and 5pm.

Mark saw David reading at the library from 5pm to 6pm. So, Mark saw him between 5pm and 6pm.

The gas station was closed after 8pm. So, the gas station was open until 8pm.

Now, I need to figure out during which time David could have gone to the gas station based on these observations.

Let's list out the times when David was seen by others:

- 7am to 12pm (Michael)
- 12pm to 2pm (Thomas)
- 2pm to 3pm (Tiffany)
- 3pm to 5pm (James)
- 5pm to 6pm (Mark)

And the gas station was open until 8pm.

So, the times when David was seen don't include 6pm to 8pm, except for Mark, who saw him up until 6pm.

But since the gas station was closed after 8pm, David wouldn't have gone there after 8pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 2pm to 3pm

(B) 6pm to 8pm

(C) 5pm to 6pm

(D) 7am to 12pm

From the timeline, David was at the gas station possibly during the 5pm to 6pm window, as that's when Mark saw him. But also, 6pm to 8pm is when the gas station was closed, so he couldn't have gone then.

So, the correct time would be 5pm to 6pm, which is option C.
</think>

The correct time David could have gone to the gas station is between 5pm and 6pm.

**Answer: (C)**
