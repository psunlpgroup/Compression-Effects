Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me start by laying out all the information provided.

First, the premise says that pets are allowed in some managed buildings. That means not all managed buildings allow pets, but at least some do. So, it's possible but not guaranteed that a managed building allows pets.

Next, a deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more. So, if the rent is $2000, the deposit is at least that. It could be more, but it can't be less.

Then, we have specific information about Fluffy being Tom's cat, and cats are pets. So, Fluffy is a pet, and Tom has a pet cat.

The Olive Garden is a managed building, and the monthly rent there is $2000. We also know that $2000 is more than $1500. So, the rent is higher than $1500.

Tom wants to rent an apartment in a managed building if he's allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. So, Tom is looking for a place where pets are allowed and the deposit is â‰¤ $1500.

Now, the conclusion we need to evaluate is: The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.

Wait, but from the premise, we know that the security deposit is either equal to the monthly rent or more. Since the monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000, the security deposit must be at least $2000. It can't be less than that. So, the security deposit is either $2000 or more. That seems straightforward.

But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The premise also mentions that if a managed building allows pets, then people can move in with a pet. So, if the Olive Garden allows pets, then Tom might be able to rent there. But the security deposit is already determined by the rent, right? So, regardless of whether it allows pets, the security deposit is tied to the rent.

Wait, but the conclusion is about the security deposit at the Olive Garden. We know the rent is $2000, so the deposit is at least that. It could be more, but it can't be less. So, the conclusion is stating that the deposit is either $2000 or more, which is exactly what the premise tells us about the security deposit in managed buildings. So, the conclusion is directly supported by the premise.

I think that's it. The conclusion is definitely true because the security deposit at the Olive Garden must be at least $2000, and it can be more. So, the conclusion holds.

The conclusion is true because the security deposit at the Olive Garden must be at least equal to the monthly rent, which is $2000. Therefore, the security deposit is either $2000 or more. 

Answer: True
