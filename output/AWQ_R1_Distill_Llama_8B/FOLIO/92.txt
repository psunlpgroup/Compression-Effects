Okay, so I need to figure out if Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden based on the given premises. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the premise says that pets are allowed in some managed buildings. That means not all managed buildings allow pets, but at least some do. So, the fact that The Olive Garden is a managed building doesn't automatically mean they allow pets, but it's possible.

Next, there's a deposit required to rent an apartment in a managed building. The security deposit can be equal to or more than the monthly rent. Here, the monthly rent is $2000, which is more than $1500. So, the security deposit at The Olive Garden is at least $2000.

Tom wants to rent an apartment in a managed building if he's allowed to move in with his cat, Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500. So, Tom's conditions are two-fold: the building allows pets and the security deposit is â‰¤$1500.

Now, looking at the premises again, there's a specific conditional statement: If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. So, this is a one-way implication. It doesn't say that if a building allows pets, then all pets are allowed, but it does establish that allowing pets implies the ability to move in with them.

But wait, the first premise says pets are allowed in some managed buildings, not necessarily all. So, the fact that The Olive Garden is a managed building doesn't confirm whether it allows pets or not. It's possible that it does, but we don't have that information.

The security deposit at The Olive Garden is at least $2000, which is more than $1500. So, Tom's condition about the security deposit being no more than $1500 isn't met. Even if The Olive Garden allowed pets, the security deposit is too high for Tom to qualify.

Putting it all together: The Olive Garden is a managed building that requires a security deposit of $2000. Since the security deposit is more than $1500, Tom can't meet his financial condition, regardless of whether the building allows pets or not. So, even if Fluffy could move in, the deposit is a showstopper.

Therefore, Tom won't be able to rent an apartment there because the security deposit is higher than he can afford.
</think>

Tom will not rent an apartment in The Olive Garden. The security deposit required is $2000, which exceeds his $1500 limit, thus he cannot meet the financial condition. 

**Answer:** False.
