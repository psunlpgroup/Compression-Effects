Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Anthony could have gone to the dance studio. So, Anthony's day starts at 7am when he wakes up. Kimberly saw him walking in the garden from 7am to 9am. That means Anthony was outside from 7am to 9am.

Then, Linda saw Anthony waiting at the train station from 10am to 1pm. So, after 9am, he must have gone to the train station and stayed there until 1pm.

Next, Susan saw Anthony attending class at the school from 1pm to 4pm. So, from 1pm to 4pm, he was at school.

After that, David saw Anthony fixing their computer at the electronic store from 4pm to 7pm. So, from 4pm to 7pm, he was at the store.

Tiffany saw Anthony reading at the library from 7pm to 8pm. So, after 7pm, he was at the library until 8pm.

Now, the dance studio was closed after 8pm. That means Anthony couldn't have gone to the dance studio after 8pm because the studio was closed.

Looking at the timeline, Anthony was at the library from 7pm to 8pm. If he left the library right at 8pm, maybe he could have gone to the dance studio just before the studio closed. But since the studio was closed after 8pm, he might not have had time to go there unless he left the library before 8pm.

Wait, but the options given are:

(A) 7am to 9am

(B) 4pm to 7pm

(C) 9am to 10am

(D) 7pm to 8pm

We know he was at the library from 7pm to 8pm. So, if he left the library just before 8pm, he could have gone to the dance studio for a short time before the studio closed at 8pm.

Therefore, the possible time he could have gone is from 7pm to 8pm, which is option (D).

But wait, let me double-check. The dance studio was closed after 8pm, so if Anthony left the library at 8pm, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio because the studio was already closed. So, actually, he couldn't have gone during that time.

Hmm, that changes things. So, if he was at the library until 8pm, he couldn't have gone to the dance studio because the studio was closed by then. So, maybe none of the options provided are correct?

But that can't be right because the question is asking between what times he could have gone, implying that one of the options is correct.

Let me look again. The options are:

(A) 7am to 9am

(B) 4pm to 7pm

(C) 9am to 10am

(D) 7pm to 8pm

He was at the garden from 7am to 9am, then at the train station from 10am to 1pm, at school from 1pm to 4pm, at the store from 4pm to 7pm, and at the library from 7pm to 8pm.

The dance studio was closed after 8pm, so he couldn't have gone after 8pm. Therefore, the latest he could have gone is before 8pm.

Looking at the options, (D) is 7pm to 8pm, which is the time he was at the library. But since he was at the library during that time, unless he left the library to go to the dance studio, but the question is about when he could have gone.

Wait, maybe the answer is (D) 7pm to 8pm because that's when the dance studio was still open. The dance studio was closed after 8pm, so between 7pm and 8pm, the studio was open.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D).
</think>

The correct answer is (D) 7pm to 8pm.

**Answer:** (D)
