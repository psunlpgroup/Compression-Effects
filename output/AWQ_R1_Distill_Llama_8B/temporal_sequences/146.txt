Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Wake-Up Time**: William wakes up at 6am.
2. **Betty's Observation**: Betty saw William at the library from 12pm to 3pm.
3. **Hannah's Observation**: Hannah saw William at the electronics store from 3pm to 4pm.
4. **Nancy's Observation**: Nancy saw William at the bakery from 4pm to 7pm.
5. **Sarah's Observation**: Sarah saw William walking from 7pm to 8pm.
6. **Michael's Observation**: Michael saw William at the theater from 8pm to 10pm.
7. **Studio Closing Time**: The art studio closes after 10pm.

**Determine the Possible Time William Could Have Visited the Art Studio:**

- William was at the library from 12pm to 3pm.
- After that, he was at the electronics store from 3pm to 4pm.
- Then, he went to the bakery from 4pm to 7pm.
- At 7pm, he started walking towards the Statue of Liberty, which took until 8pm.
- From 8pm to 10pm, he was at the theater.

The art studio was closed after 10pm, so William likely couldn't have visited it after 10pm.

Considering the timeline, the only free time William had before 10pm is between 6am to 12pm, when he was not observed by anyone.

**Answer:** (B) 6am to 12pm

The correct answer is \boxed{B}.
