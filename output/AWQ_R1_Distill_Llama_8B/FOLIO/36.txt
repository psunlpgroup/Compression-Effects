Alright, so I need to figure out if the conclusion "Beethoven is a composer" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premise. Let me start by breaking down the premises and see what logical connections I can make.

First, the premise states that Symphony No. 9 is a music piece. That's straightforward. Then it mentions that composers write music pieces. So, if someone writes a music piece, they must be a composer. That seems like a key link here.

Next, it says Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9. So Beethoven is the one who created this piece. If Beethoven wrote it, and composers write music pieces, then Beethoven must be a composer. That seems pretty direct, but let me check the other points to make sure I'm not missing anything.

The premise also mentions the Vienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9. That's about the performance aspect, but it's not directly related to Beethoven's role as a composer. It does say that the Vienna Music Society is an orchestra, which is led by conductors. However, since Beethoven is leading the Vienna Music Society, that means he's the conductor there. But does that affect his role as a composer?

Wait, so Beethoven is a conductor and a composer. But the conclusion is specifically about him being a composer. The premise clearly states that he wrote Symphony No. 9, so regardless of his role as a conductor, the fact that he wrote it makes him a composer. 

I don't see any information that would contradict this. There's no part of the premise that says Beethoven isn't a composer; in fact, it directly states he wrote the symphony. Therefore, the conclusion should be true.

The conclusion that "Beethoven is a composer" is supported by the premise. Since the premise explicitly states that Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9, and composers are defined as those who write music pieces, the logical deduction confirms that Beethoven holds the role of a composer.

**Answer:** True.
