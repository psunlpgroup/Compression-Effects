Alright, let's try to figure out when Mary could have gone to the amusement park. Okay, let's start by listing out all the information given.

Mary wakes up at 1pm. So that's when her day starts.

Then, Richard saw Mary stretching at a yoga studio from 1pm to 3pm. So Mary was at the yoga studio during that time.

Next, Jessica saw Mary taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 3pm to 4pm. So after the yoga session, Mary was taking photos.

Then, Samantha saw Mary fixing their computer at the electronic store from 4pm to 6pm. So that's a longer period where Mary was occupied.

After that, Sean saw Mary getting a coffee at the cafe from 6pm to 7pm. So she took a coffee break.

Finally, Kimberly saw Mary working at the office from 9pm to 10pm. So that's quite late in the day.

Now, the amusement park was closed after 10pm. So Mary couldn't have gone there after 10pm because it was already closed.

Let's piece this together. Mary starts her day at 1pm. She's at the yoga studio until 3pm. Then she's taking photos until 4pm. After that, she's fixing the computer until 6pm. She takes a coffee break from 6pm to 7pm. Then she's working at the office from 9pm to 10pm.

Wait, so when could she have gone to the amusement park? The amusement park is closed after 10pm, so she must have gone before that. Let's see the times when she wasn't occupied.

From 1pm to 3pm: She's at the yoga studio.
From 3pm to 4pm: She's taking photos.
From 4pm to 6pm: She's fixing the computer.
From 6pm to 7pm: She's getting coffee.
From 9pm to 10pm: She's working.

So, the only times she's free are between 7pm and 9pm. Because from 6pm to 7pm, she's getting coffee, and then from 7pm to 9pm, she's free. So that's a two-hour window.

So, she could have gone to the amusement park any time between 7pm and 9pm.

Let's double-check the options:

(A) 9pm to 10pm: But the park is closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone then.

(B) 1pm to 3pm: She's at the yoga studio during that time.

(C) 3pm to 4pm: She's taking photos.

(D) 7pm to 9pm: That's when she's free.

So, the correct answer is (D).

**Answer: (D) 7pm to 9pm**
