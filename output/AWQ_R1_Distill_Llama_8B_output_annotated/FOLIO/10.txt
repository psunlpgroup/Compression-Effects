[0] Okay, let's try to figure out if Tom is an Eastern wild turkey based on the given premises. [0] So, first, I need to list out all the types of wild turkeys mentioned: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, Rio Grande, and Ocellated. [3] That's six types in total. 

[1] Now, the premises say that Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey. [1] So, Tom ≠ Eastern. [1] Similarly, Tom is not an Osceola, so Tom ≠ Osceola. [1] He's also not a Gould’s, so Tom ≠ Gould’s. [1] Then, it says Tom is neither a Merriam’s nor a Rio Grande, which means Tom is not Merriam’s and Tom is not Rio Grande. [1] So, from this, we can eliminate those four types: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande.

[4] Wait,[3] but there are six types in total. [1] So, the only types left that Tom could be are Ocellated. [1] Because we've eliminated the other five, and Tom is a wild turkey, so he must be one of these six. [1] Therefore, Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey.

[4] But the conclusion says Tom is an Eastern wild turkey, which is one of the types we already eliminated. [5] So, that can't be right. [1] Therefore, the conclusion is false because Tom is actually an Ocellated wild turkey, not an Eastern one.

**Answer:** False.

**Explanation:** 

[1] From the premises, Tom is excluded from five types of wild turkeys: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande. [2] Since there are only six types of wild turkeys and Tom is a wild turkey, the only possible type left is Ocellated. [1] Therefore, the conclusion that Tom is an Eastern wild turkey is incorrect.
