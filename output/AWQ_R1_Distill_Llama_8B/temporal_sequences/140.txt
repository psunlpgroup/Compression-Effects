Alright, let's try to figure out when Anthony could have gone to the gas station. So, Anthony wakes up at 5am. Susan saw him reading at the library from 5am to 7am. Then Sarah saw him walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 7am to 10am. After that, Nancy saw him working out at the gym from 5pm to 7pm. David saw him driving to the water park from 7pm to 8pm. The gas station was closed after 8pm.

Okay, so I need to find the time window when Anthony was free to go to the gas station. Let's list out the times when Anthony was occupied:

- **5am to 7am**: At the library with Susan.
- **7am to 10am**: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty with Sarah.
- **5pm to 7pm**: Working out at the gym with Nancy.
- **7pm to 8pm**: Driving to the water park with David.

The gas station closes after 8pm, so Anthony would have to go before it's closed. But from the timeline, it looks like the last time Anthony was seen was at 8pm when David saw him driving to the water park. The gas station is closed after 8pm, so Anthony couldn't have gone to the gas station after 8pm.

Now, let's see if there's any time before 5am when he could have gone. But he wakes up at 5am, so before that, he wasn't at the gas station.

Looking at the times he was occupied:

- **5am to 7am**: At the library.
- **7am to 10am**: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty.
  
So, between 10am and 5pm, was he free? It seems like from 10am to 5pm, he wasn't seen doing anything. Maybe he was at home or doing something else. Similarly, from 5pm to 7pm, he was at the gym. So, the only free time seems to be between 10am and 5pm.

Wait, but let's double-check. After 7am, he was seen until 10am at the Statue of Liberty. Then, from 5pm to 7pm, he was at the gym. So, the only free time is between 10am and 5pm when he wasn't occupied.

Therefore, the time between 10am and 5pm is when Anthony could have gone to the gas station.

Looking at the options:

(A) 7pm to 8pm  
(B) 10am to 5pm  
(C) 5pm to 7pm  
(D) 5am to 7am  

So, the correct answer should be (B) 10am to 5pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (B) 10am to 5pm.

**Answer:** (B)
