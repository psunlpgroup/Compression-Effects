Alright, let's try to figure out when Sarah could have gone to the construction site. I'll need to look at the timeline provided and see when she wasn't being spotted by others.

First, Sarah wakes up at 5am. Then, William sees her on the rooftop from 5am to 11am. So, from 5am to 11am, Sarah is visible on the rooftop.

Next, Mary sees Sarah at the library from 11am to 3pm. So, from 11am to 3pm, she's at the library reading.

Then, Jessica sees Sarah walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 4pm. So, between 3pm and 4pm, she's walking.

Leslie sees Sarah playing tennis at the tennis court from 7pm to 8pm. So, from 7pm to 8pm, she's playing tennis.

The construction site was closed after 8pm, so Sarah couldn't have gone there after 8pm.

Now, let's see when she's not being spotted:

- From 5am to 11am: on the rooftop.
- 11am to 3pm: at the library.
- 3pm to 4pm: walking.
- 7pm to 8pm: playing tennis.

So, the times when she's not being spotted are between 4pm to 7pm and after 8pm. But the construction site was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone after that.

Therefore, the only possible time is between 4pm to 7pm.

Let me double-check the options:

(A) 11am to 3pm — She's at the library then, so that's not possible.

(B) 4pm to 7pm — This fits because no one saw her here.

(C) 3pm to 4pm — She's walking then, so that's not possible.

(D) 7pm to 8pm — She's playing tennis, so that's not possible.

Yes, option B is correct.

The construction site was closed after 8pm, so Sarah couldn't have gone after that time. The only available window is between 4pm to 7pm when no one saw her.

**Answer: (B) 4pm to 7pm**
