Alright, let's try to figure out when Ashley could have gone to the gas station based on the information provided.

First, let's list out all the times when Ashley was seen by different people:

1. **Ashley woke up at 5am.**
   
   - This is the earliest time we know Ashley was active.

2. **Nancy saw Ashley buying cookies at a bakery from 6am to 7am.**
   
   - So, between 6am and 7am, Nancy saw Ashley at the bakery.

3. **David saw Ashley working at the office from 7am to 1pm.**
   
   - This means Ashley was at the office from 7am until 1pm.

4. **Tiffany saw Ashley buying a phone at the electronics store from 1pm to 3pm.**
   
   - So, between 1pm and 3pm, Ashley was at the electronics store.

5. **Mary saw Ashley getting a coffee at the cafe from 3pm to 4pm.**
   
   - Therefore, Ashley was at the cafe from 3pm to 4pm.

6. **Lisa saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 10pm.**
   
   - This means Ashley was at the deli from 4pm until 10pm.

7. **The gas station was closed after 10pm.**
   
   - So, the gas station was only open during its regular hours, which ended at 10pm.

Now, let's try to piece together Ashley's possible schedule based on these observations:

- **5am to 6am:** Ashley just woke up, so this is the earliest possible time she could have been at the gas station before going to the bakery.
  
- **6am to 7am:** She was buying cookies at the bakery, so she couldn't have been at the gas station during this time.
  
- **7am to 1pm:** She was working at the office, so she couldn't have been at the gas station during this period either.
  
- **1pm to 3pm:** She was buying a phone, so no time for the gas station here.
  
- **3pm to 4pm:** She was getting coffee, so again, no time for the gas station.
  
- **4pm to 10pm:** She was buying lunch, so the gas station would have to be before this time.

Since the gas station was closed after 10pm, Ashley would have needed to go earlier in the day. The only possible window before her activities are:

- **5am to 6am:** Right after waking up.
  
- **6am to 7am:** But during this time, she was buying cookies, so she couldn't have gone to the gas station.

Therefore, the only plausible time she could have gone to the gas station is between **5am to 6am**, right after waking up.

However, let's double-check the options provided:

- **(A) 3pm to 4pm:** She was getting coffee, so no.
  
- **(B) 6am to 7am:** She was buying cookies, so no.
  
- **(C) 7am to 1pm:** She was working, so no.
  
- **(D) 5am to 6am:** This aligns with our initial assessment.

Therefore, the correct answer is **(D)**.

Based on the timeline provided, Ashley could have gone to the gas station between **5am to 6am**.

**Answer:** (D)
