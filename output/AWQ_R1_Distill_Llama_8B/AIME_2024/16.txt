Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, I need to compute r squared and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and finally find p + q. 

Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a fixed surface area of 54 and a fixed volume of 23. For each such box, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The radius of this sphere will be the same for all boxes in the set because they all have the same surface area and volume. So, our goal is to find the minimal radius r such that any box in set B can fit inside a sphere of radius r.

First, let's recall some properties of a rectangular box. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height, which we can denote as x, y, and z respectively. The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume (V) is xyz = 23.

We also know that for a box to fit inside a sphere, the space diagonal of the box must be less than or equal to the diameter of the sphere. The space diagonal d of a box with dimensions x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Since the sphere's diameter is 2r, we have the inequality sqrt(x² + y² + z²) ≤ 2r. Therefore, r must be at least half the space diagonal of the box. To find the smallest possible r that works for all boxes in B, we need to maximize the space diagonal over all possible boxes in B. So, r is equal to half the maximum possible space diagonal.

Thus, our task reduces to finding the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, let's formalize this:

We need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) subject to:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

To make it easier, perhaps we can work with the squared terms since sqrt is a monotonic function. So, we can maximize x² + y² + z².

Let me denote S = x² + y² + z² and P = xyz = 23, and Q = xy + yz + xz = 27 (since 2Q = 54).

So, we have:

- Q = 27
- P = 23
- S = ?

We need to maximize S.

Now, I remember that for three variables, there's a relation involving S, Q, and P. Specifically, for positive real numbers x, y, z, we have the identity:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz) = S + 2Q

But I don't know if that helps directly. Alternatively, I recall that for variables constrained by their sum and products, we can use Lagrange multipliers to find maxima.

So, let's try using Lagrange multipliers.

We need to maximize S = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (which simplifies to xy + yz + xz = 27)
2. xyz = 23

So, set up the Lagrangian function:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ, and set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x:

2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, ∂L/∂y:

2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

And ∂L/∂z:

2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

Also, the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27

xyz = 23

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
2. 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
3. 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0
4. xy + yz + xz = 27
5. xyz = 23

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can assume symmetry or particular relations between x, y, z.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that two variables are equal. Let me see.

Suppose that x = y. Then, let's see if that leads us somewhere.

Let x = y, then:

From the surface area constraint:

x² + xz + zx = 27 => x² + 2xz = 27

From the volume constraint:

x² z = 23

So, let me denote x = y, so:

Equation 1: x² + 2xz = 27

Equation 2: x² z = 23

We can solve these equations for x and z.

From Equation 2: z = 23 / (x²)

Substitute into Equation 1:

x² + 2x*(23 / (x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

So, we have a cubic equation in x: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0

x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 → Hey, x=2 is a root!

So, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0

Thus, the roots are x=2, and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ± 2√6

Since x is a length, it must be positive, so x=2 or x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899

So, x=2 or x≈3.899

Let me compute z for x=2:

From Equation 2: z = 23 / (2²) = 23 / 4 = 5.75

So, dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75

Compute S = x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625

Alternatively, for x ≈3.899, which is -1 + 2√6:

Compute z = 23 / (x²)

But x ≈3.899, so x²≈15.21

Then z≈23 /15.21≈1.514

Compute S = x² + y² + z²≈15.21 +15.21 +2.295≈32.715

So, S is smaller in this case, so the maximum S is achieved when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving S≈41.0625

But is this the maximum? Wait, maybe not necessarily. Because when we assumed x=y, perhaps the maximum occurs when all three variables are equal? Let me check.

Suppose x=y=z.

Then, from surface area:

3x² =27 → x²=9 →x=3

Volume: x³=27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27.

Therefore, such a box with x=y=z=3 doesn't satisfy the volume constraint.

Thus, the box cannot be a cube. So, the maximum S occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different.

Wait, but in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, we get S≈41.06, but when x=y≈3.899, z≈1.514, we get S≈32.715, which is less.

But is this the only case? Maybe not. Perhaps there's a case where all three variables are different, giving a higher S.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum S is achieved when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible. Hmm.

Wait, but since the volume is fixed, if one variable is larger, the others have to be smaller.

But how does that affect S? It might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers more formally.

Let me denote the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

Also, the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27

xyz=23

So, we have five equations:

1. 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

2. 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

3. 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

4. xy + yz + xz =27

5. xyz=23

This is a system of nonlinear equations which might be tricky, but perhaps we can find a relation between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

[2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] - [2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz)] =0

Which simplifies to:

2x - 2y - λ(y + z - x - z) - μ(yz - xz) =0

Simplify:

2(x - y) - λ(y - x) - μ z(y - x) =0

Factor (x - y):

[2 + λ + μ z] (x - y) =0

Similarly, if x ≠ y, then 2 + λ + μ z=0

Similarly, subtract equation 1 and equation 3:

2x - 2z - λ(y + z - x - y) - μ(yz - xy)=0

Simplify:

2(x - z) - λ(z - x) - μ y(z - x)=0

Factor (x - z):

[2 + λ + μ y] (x - z)=0

Again, if x ≠ z, then 2 + λ + μ y=0

Similarly, from the first subtraction, we have 2 + λ + μ z=0

And from the second subtraction, 2 + λ + μ y=0

Thus, setting them equal:

2 + λ + μ z = 2 + λ + μ y

Which implies μ z = μ y

If μ ≠0, then z=y

Similarly, if we subtract equation 2 and equation 3, we can get another relation.

But perhaps let's assume that y = z, similar to what we did earlier.

Wait, but from the above, if μ ≠0, then z = y.

So, perhaps two variables are equal.

So, let's assume y = z.

Then, our constraints become:

From surface area: xy + y² + xz =27 → x y + y² + x y =27 → 2x y + y²=27

From volume: x y²=23

So, let me denote y = z.

Then, we have:

Equation 1: 2x y + y² =27

Equation 2: x y²=23

We can solve for x from Equation 2: x=23/(y²)

Substitute into Equation 1:

2*(23/y²)*y + y² =27

Simplify:

46/y + y²=27

Multiply both sides by y:

46 + y³ =27 y

Bring all terms to one side:

y³ -27 y +46=0

So, similar to the previous case, but with y instead of x.

Again, trying rational roots, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing y=1:1 -27 +46=20≠0

y=2:8 -54 +46=0→ y=2 is a root.

So, factor as (y -2)(y² +2y -23)=0

Thus, roots are y=2 and y=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4√6)/2= -1 ±2√6

Again, y must be positive, so y=2 or y≈-1 +2√6≈3.899

So, for y=2:

From Equation 2: x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75

So, x=5.75, y=2, z=2

Compute S=5.75² +2² +2²=33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625

For y≈3.899:

Compute x=23/(y²)=23/(15.21)≈1.514

So, x≈1.514, y≈3.899, z≈3.899

Compute S≈(1.514)^2 + (3.899)^2 + (3.899)^2≈2.295 +15.21 +15.21≈32.715

Again, S is smaller in this case.

Therefore, the maximum S is 41.0625, which is 41.0625= 41 + 1/16= 657/16

Wait, 41.0625 is 41 and 1/16, which is 41*16 +1=656 +1=657, so 657/16.

So, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4

But we need to find the minimal sphere radius r such that sqrt(x² + y² + z²) ≤2r.

Thus, r must be at least half of the space diagonal, so r= (sqrt(S))/2.

Wait, but actually, in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=41.0625, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609, so 2r≈3.218, but actually, the sphere must contain the box, so the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal, so the radius must be at least half of that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609. So, the diameter is about 3.218, so the radius is about 1.609.

But we need to ensure that this is the minimal r such that all boxes in B can fit inside a sphere of radius r. So, we need to make sure that for any box in B, its space diagonal is less than or equal to 2r.

But is the maximum space diagonal achieved when x=y=2, z=5.75?

Wait, perhaps, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when two variables are equal, but I need to confirm.

Wait, in the Lagrangian approach, when we subtracted the equations, we found that either variables are equal or certain relations hold.

But given that in both cases when we set two variables equal, we get S=657/16 and S≈32.715, so the former is larger.

But is there a case where all three variables are different and S is larger?

I think not, because in order to maximize S, given fixed Q and P, the maximum S occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible, given the constraints.

Wait, but in our case, when we set two variables equal, we obtained a specific case where S is maximized. Since we have found that case, perhaps that is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the root mean square.

We know that for positive numbers a, b, c:

sqrt((a² + b² + c²)/3) ≥ (a + b + c)/3

But not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities to relate S, Q, and P.

Wait, another approach: from the theory of symmetric functions, for variables with given sum of products and product, we can express S in terms of Q and P.

But I don't recall the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for three variables, the following identity holds:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz)

But we don't know x + y + z.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality for x, y, z.

But I don't think that's directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution.

Let me denote a = x, b = y, c = z.

Given that:

ab + bc + ca =27

abc=23

We can use the method of symmetric polynomials.

Let me denote s1 = a + b + c

s2 = ab + bc + ca =27

s3 = abc=23

We know that for three variables, we can relate s1, s2, s3 with the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c.

So, the cubic equation is t³ - s1 t² + s2 t - s3=0, which is t³ - s1 t² +27 t -23=0

But I don't know s1, so perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, we can use the inequality that relates s1, s2, s3.

Wait, perhaps another idea.

We can fix s2 and s3, and then find the minimal or maximal s1² = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca) = S + 2*27= S +54

Thus, s1² = S +54.

But we also know that for positive numbers, s1³ ≥ 27 abc (AM ≥ GM)

So, s1³ ≥27*23=621

Thus, s1 ≥ cube root of 621≈8.56

But s1 is a + b + c, so it's just a number.

Alternatively, maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Let me fix two variables, say x and y, and express z in terms of x and y.

From the volume constraint: z=23/(xy)

From the surface area constraint: 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 → xy + yz + xz=27

Substitute z=23/(xy):

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))=27

Simplify:

xy + 23/x +23/y=27

So, we have:

xy +23/x +23/y=27

Let me denote t = x y

Then, the equation becomes:

t +23/t +23/t=27 → Wait, no.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, 23/x +23/y is not 23/t.

Wait, let me think.

Wait, if t=xy, then 23/x +23/y=23(1/x +1/y)=23(y +x)/(xy)=23(x + y)/t

So, the equation becomes:

t +23(x + y)/t=27

But x + y can be expressed as (x + y)= s - z, but we don't have s.

Hmm, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let u = x + y and v = xy

Then, z=23/v

And the surface area equation becomes:

v +23/u=27

Wait, no, because 23/x +23/y=23(u)/v

So, the equation is v +23u/v=27

Multiply both sides by v:

v² +23u=27v

So, v² -27v +23u=0

But u and v are related by u² ≥4v (since (x + y)^2 ≥4xy)

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps fix u= x + y and v=xy, and then we have:

v² -27v +23u=0

But we also have u² ≥4v

So, perhaps we can express u in terms of v: u= (27v -v²)/23

Then, plug into u² ≥4v:

[(27v -v²)/23]^2 ≥4v

This would give a quadratic in v:

(27v -v²)^2 /23² ≥4v

Multiply both sides by 23²:

(27v -v²)^2 ≥4v*529

Expand the left side:

(27v -v²)^2 = (27v)^2 - 2*27v*v² + (v²)^2 =729v² -54v³ +v^4

So, we have:

729v² -54v³ +v^4 ≥4v*529=2116v

Bring all terms to left:

v^4 -54v³ +729v² -2116v ≥0

Factor:

v(v³ -54v² +729v -2116) ≥0

Hmm, this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier result where x=y=2, z=5.75 gives the maximum S=657/16.

Thus, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4, so r= sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, hold on, because the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, so the sphere radius must be half of that, which is sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, no, wait: the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(S). The sphere's diameter must be at least that, so radius is at least half of that.

So, r= (sqrt(S))/2= sqrt(657)/8.

But wait, sqrt(657)/8 is approximately sqrt(625 +32)/8≈25.03/8≈3.128.

But wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius is half of that, which is≈3.218.

Wait, but in this case, r≈3.218.

But earlier, I thought that the radius needed is sqrt(657)/8≈3.128, but that's not correct because the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609, so radius is half of that≈0.804, which is not correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609.

But that can't be, because if x=2, y=2, z=5.75, then space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, not 1.609.

Wait, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, S =x² + y² + z²=657/16.

So sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257.

Wait, no, 25.03/4≈6.257, but sqrt(657)=25.03, so sqrt(657)/4≈6.257.

Wait, no, 25.03/4≈6.257.

Wait, but if S=657/16, then sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257.

So, the space diagonal is≈6.257, so the sphere's diameter must be at least≈6.257, so radius≈3.128.

But when we computed for x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal was sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, which is larger than 6.257.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, then S=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437.

But earlier, when we used Lagrange multipliers, we found a critical point where x=y=2, z=5.75, which gives S=41.0625.

But when we assumed y=z, we found that x=5.75, y=z=2, which is the same as above.

So, perhaps that is indeed the maximum S.

But then, why in the earlier approach with Lagrangian multipliers, when we assumed x=y, we got a maximum S=41.0625.

So, perhaps that is the maximum S, hence the maximum space diagonal.

Thus, r is half of that, so r= sqrt(41.0625)/2=6.437/2≈3.218.

Wait, but 41.0625=657/16.

So, sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, so r= sqrt(657)/8≈3.128.

Wait, but 6.437/2≈3.218.

Wait, confusion arises from the fact that sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, so radius is half of that≈3.128.

But when we compute space diagonal from x=y=2, z=5.75, we get sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius is half≈3.218.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, when we have S=657/16, then sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257.

But the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, so the sphere's diameter is 2r≥sqrt(S), so r≥sqrt(S)/2≈6.257/2≈3.128.

But wait, in reality, for the specific box with x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so in that case, r must be at least≈3.218.

So, which one is larger? 3.218 is larger, so that would be the minimal r required.

Wait, but sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, so r≈3.128, but the specific box has space diagonal≈6.437, so r must be at least≈3.218.

Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is≈6.437, so r≈3.218.

But wait, is that the maximum possible space diagonal over all boxes in B?

Because if we can have a box with a larger space diagonal, then r would have to be larger.

But from our earlier exploration, when we set x=y=2, z=5.75, we get the space diagonal≈6.437, which is larger than when we set x=y≈3.899, z≈1.514, which had a smaller space diagonal.

So, is this the maximum?

Wait, perhaps. Let me check if another configuration could give a larger space diagonal.

Suppose one variable is very large, and the other two are very small.

But due to the volume constraint, if one variable is very large, the other two must be very small such that their product with the large variable gives a fixed volume.

But how does that affect the space diagonal?

Let me suppose x approaches infinity, then y and z must approach zero such that xyz=23.

So, suppose x approaches infinity, y approaches zero, z approaches zero, such that x*y*z=23.

But then, the surface area would be 2(xy + yz + xz)=54.

If x is large, and y, z are small, then xy and xz would be large, but yz would be negligible.

So, 2(xy + xz)=54 → x(y + z)=27.

But since x*y*z=23, and y,z are small, let me set y=z.

So, y=z, then:

x*(2y)=27 →x=27/(2y)

And volume: x y²=23→ (27/(2y)) * y²=23→ (27 y)/2=23→ y= (46)/27≈1.7037

Then, x=27/(2*1.7037)≈27/3.407≈7.94

So, x≈7.94, y=z≈1.7037

Compute S= x² + y² + z²≈63.04 +2.896 +2.896≈68.832

Thus, space diagonal≈sqrt(68.832)≈8.29

Which is larger than the previous maximum of≈6.437.

Wait, so that's a problem because if this is the case, then the maximum space diagonal is≈8.29, which would mean that r≈4.145

But how is that possible? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, hold on, because if x approaches infinity, y and z approach zero, but in our case, x, y, z are positive real numbers, so they can't actually approach infinity or zero, but can become arbitrarily large or small.

But in our problem, we have fixed surface area and fixed volume, so perhaps the space diagonal can be made arbitrarily large? But no, since volume is fixed, if x increases, y and z must decrease.

But let's see, is there a maximum for the space diagonal?

Wait, the problem is that when we fix volume and surface area, can the space diagonal be unbounded? Or is there a maximum?

Wait, actually, for fixed volume and surface area, is the space diagonal bounded?

Hmm, let me think.

If we let x become very large, then y and z become very small, but the surface area would require that x(y + z)≈27, as we saw earlier.

But then, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). If x is large, but y and z are small, does this necessarily make the space diagonal large?

Wait, for example, if x is 100, then y and z would be approximately sqrt(23/(100))≈0.22 each, but then x(y + z)=100*(0.22 +0.22)=44, which is less than 27? Wait, no, that's not.

Wait, let's correct that.

Wait, from surface area: x(y + z)=27/2≈13.5

If x=100, then y + z=13.5/100≈0.135

But volume: x y z=23, so 100 y z=23→ y z=0.23

But y + z=0.135, so we have:

y + z=0.135

y z=0.23

But the discriminant of the quadratic equation t² -0.135 t +0.23=0 is (0.135)^2 -4*0.23≈0.0182 -0.92≈-0.9018 <0

So, no real solution, meaning that such y and z do not exist.

Therefore, x cannot be 100.

So, perhaps there is a maximum x beyond which no real y and z exist.

Thus, the space diagonal cannot be made arbitrarily large.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when y and z are equal, which is the case we computed earlier.

Wait, but when I tried y=z≈1.7037, x≈7.94, I got S≈68.832, so space diagonal≈8.29.

But is that the maximum?

Wait, let's compute the space diagonal for that case:

x≈7.94, y=z≈1.7037

Compute S≈7.94² +1.7037² +1.7037²≈63.04 +2.896 +2.896≈68.832

So, sqrt(68.832)≈8.29.

But let me check if that is indeed a maximum.

Wait, when I set y=z, we get a specific case where two variables are equal, but is that the maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when one variable is much larger than the others, but we saw that when we tried to set x very large, we couldn't find real y and z.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum is achieved when y=z, which gives S≈68.832.

But wait, in that case, S≈68.832=1089/16.

Wait, 68.832*16≈1095.312, which is not exact.

Wait, 68.832=68 + 0.832.

0.832*16≈13.312, so total≈68 +13.312≈81.312, which is not helpful.

Wait, perhaps exact value.

Wait, in the case when y=z, we had:

From surface area: 2x y + y²=27

From volume: x y²=23

Set y=z.

So, equation 1: 2x y + y²=27

Equation 2: x y²=23

Express x from equation 2: x=23/(y²)

Plug into equation 1:

2*(23/y²)*y + y²=27

Simplify:

46/y + y²=27

Multiply both sides by y:

46 + y³=27 y

Thus, y³ -27 y +46=0

As before, roots are y=2 and y=(-2 ±sqrt(4 + 92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 + 9.798)/2≈3.899

So, y=2 is a root, giving x=23/(2²)=5.75, space diagonal sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437

Another root is y≈3.899, giving x≈1.514, space diagonal≈sqrt(1.514² +3.899² +3.899²)=sqrt(2.295 +15.21 +15.21)=sqrt(32.715)=5.727

Wait, no, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, hold on, when y=3.899, x≈1.514, so x≈1.514, y=z≈3.899

Compute S= x² + y² + z²≈2.295 +15.21 +15.21≈32.715

So, sqrt(S)=sqrt(32.715)≈5.727

But earlier, when y=1.7037, x≈7.94, space diagonal≈8.29

But wait, how does that align with our previous result?

Wait, in the case when we assumed y=z, we had two roots, y=2 and y≈3.899, but in reality, when we assumed y=z, we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, which gave us y=2 and y≈3.899, but when we set y=1.7037, that wasn't a solution from that equation.

Wait, I think I got confused.

Wait, when we set y=z, we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899.

So, the case where y=1.7037, x≈7.94 is not under the assumption that y=z.

So, actually, that case is a different scenario where perhaps x is not equal to y=z.

Wait, so in that case, how did I get y=1.7037?

Wait, earlier, I tried to fix x=100, but that didn't work because it led to an impossible equation for y and z.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in order to find the maximum space diagonal, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different, as in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75.

But when I tried y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, I got a higher S=68.832, which would imply a higher space diagonal≈8.29, which is larger than the previous case.

But in that case, how did that happen?

Wait, perhaps because in that case, y and z are not equal to each other or to x.

Wait, but in that case, x is different from y and z.

Wait, but if x, y, z are all different, perhaps that could give a higher S.

But how?

Wait, maybe I can consider that the maximum of S occurs when one variable is as large as possible, given the constraints.

But how to formalize that.

Alternatively, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, earlier, we had:

From the Lagrangian, we found that if x ≠ y ≠ z, then:

From the partial derivatives, we had:

2x - λ(y + z) - μ y z=0

2y - λ(x + z) - μ x z=0

2z - λ(x + y) - μ x y=0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz=27

xyz=23

So, let me denote equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ y z

Equation 2: 2y = λ(x + z) + μ x z

Equation 3: 2z = λ(x + y) + μ x y

Now, let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

2x -2y = λ(y + z -x - z) + μ(y z -x z)

Simplify:

2(x - y)= λ(y - x) + μ z(y -x)

Factor:

[2 + λ + μ z](x - y)=0

So, either x=y, or 2 + λ + μ z=0

Similarly, subtract equation 1 -3:

2x -2z=λ(y + z -x - y) + μ(y z -x y)

Simplify:

2(x - z)=λ(z -x) + μ y(z -x)

Factor:

[2 + λ + μ y](x - z)=0

So, either x=z, or 2 + λ + μ y=0

Similarly, subtract equation 2-3:

2y -2z=λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(x z -x y)

Simplify:

2(y - z)=λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor:

[2 + λ + μ x](y - z)=0

So, either y=z, or 2 + λ + μ x=0

So, in summary, either variables are equal, or 2 + λ + μ times the difference equals zero.

Therefore, either variables are equal, or 2 + λ + μ times (difference of variables)=0.

Therefore, in the case where variables are not equal, we have 2 + λ + μ times (difference)=0.

But since this must hold for all pairs, unless all variables are equal, which would require λ and μ to be related accordingly.

Wait, but if variables are not equal, then 2 + λ + μ times (x - y)=0, and similarly for other differences.

But if x ≠ y and x ≠ z and y ≠ z, then we have:

2 + λ + μ z=0

2 + λ + μ y=0

2 + λ + μ x=0

Subtracting the first and second equations:

(2 + λ + μ z) - (2 + λ + μ y)=0 ⇒ μ(z - y)=0

Similarly, since z ≠ y, this implies μ=0.

Similarly, subtracting first and third equations:

μ(x - z)=0, since x ≠ z, μ=0.

Therefore, μ=0.

Then, from equation 1: 2x= λ(y + z)

From equation 2: 2y=λ(x + z)

From equation 3: 2z=λ(x + y)

So, with μ=0, we have:

2x=λ(y + z)

2y=λ(x + z)

2z=λ(x + y)

So, from equations 1 and 2:

2x=λ(y + z)

2y=λ(x + z)

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

(2x)/(2y)= [λ(y + z)]/[λ(x + z)] ⇒ x/y=(y + z)/(x + z)

Cross multiply:

x(x + z)=y(y + z)

Similarly, from equations 2 and 3:

2y=λ(x + z)

2z=λ(x + y)

Divide equation 2 by equation 3:

(2y)/(2z)= [λ(x + z)]/[λ(x + y)] ⇒ y/z=(x + z)/(x + y)

Cross multiply:

y(x + y)=z(x + z)

So, now we have two equations:

1. x(x + z)=y(y + z)

2. y(x + y)=z(x + z)

Let me denote equation 1:

x² + x z = y² + y z

Equation 2:

y x + y² = z x + z²

Let me rearrange equation 1:

x² - y² + x z - y z=0

Factor:

(x - y)(x + y) + z(x - y)=0

Factor:

(x - y)(x + y + z)=0

Similarly, since x ≠ y, we have x + y + z=0

But x, y, z are positive, so this is impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that x=y.

Similarly, from equation 2:

y x + y² = z x + z²

Rearrange:

y x - z x + y² - z²=0

Factor:

x(y - z) + (y - z)(y + z)=0

Factor:

(y - z)(x + y + z)=0

Again, since y ≠ z, we have x + y + z=0, which is impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is x=y=z.

But if x=y=z, then the box is a cube.

But earlier, we saw that a cube with surface area 54 would have edge length 3, but volume would be 27, which is larger than 23. Therefore, a cube is not a solution here.

Thus, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal.

Therefore, the maximum S occurs when two variables are equal, either x=y or y=z.

We saw that when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=41.0625.

When y=z=2, x=5.75, same result.

But earlier, when I tried to set y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, I found a larger S=68.832, but that was under the assumption that y=z, which led to a cubic equation with roots y=2 and y≈3.899.

Wait, but in that case, when y=z=1.7037, that wasn't a solution to the cubic equation.

Wait, perhaps that was an error.

Wait, when we set y=z, we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899.

Thus, y cannot be 1.7037 if we set y=z.

Therefore, that case is not valid because when y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, it doesn't satisfy the surface area and volume constraints.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried to set x=100, I found that it's impossible because the quadratic equation had no real roots.

Thus, perhaps the maximum S is achieved when y=z=2, x=5.75, giving S=41.0625.

Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius r=6.437/2≈3.218.

But 41.0625 is 657/16, so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, but that conflicts with the direct computation from x=y=2, z=5.75.

Wait, I think the confusion comes from the fact that 41.0625 is S, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, but in reality, when x=y=2, z=5.75, sqrt(S)=sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, 41.0625=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, which is correct.

So, sqrt(41.0625)=6.437.

But 657/16=41.0625, so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, which is less than 6.437.

Therefore, the exact value is sqrt(657)/4, but when we compute from x=y=2, z=5.75, we get sqrt(41.0625)=6.437.

Wait, but 41.0625 is 657/16, so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257.

But 6.257 is less than 6.437.

So, this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that 657/16 is 41.0625, but sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, but when computed from x=y=2, z=5.75, sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, no, 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, which is 657/16.

So, sqrt(41.0625)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257.

Wait, but 6.257 squared is≈41.06, which is correct.

Wait, but when I compute sqrt(41.0625), which is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, that's incorrect because 6.437 squared is≈41.1, but 41.0625 is 657/16.

Wait, no, 6.437 squared is≈41.1, which is close to 41.0625.

Wait, but 6.437 squared= (6 +0.437)^2=36 + 2*6*0.437 +0.437²≈36 +5.224 +0.190≈41.414, which is larger than 41.0625.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(41.0625):

sqrt(41.0625)=sqrt(41 +0.0625)=sqrt(41 +1/16)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257.

Wait, but 6.257 squared≈41.06, which is correct.

But when I computed sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, but earlier, I thought it was 6.437.

Wait, no, 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, so sqrt(41.0625)=6.257.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding.

Wait, 4 +4=8, 8 +33.0625=41.0625, so yes, sqrt(41.0625)=6.257.

But earlier, I thought of sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, but that was incorrect.

Therefore, sqrt(S)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, so radius r=6.257/2≈3.128.

But when I computed for x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal was sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, which is correct.

So, r=6.257/2≈3.128.

But when I tried setting y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, I found S≈68.832, but that was incorrect because in reality, y=z=1.7037 doesn't satisfy the surface area equation.

Wait, so that case was invalid because when I set y=z, it must satisfy y³ -27 y +46=0, which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899.

Thus, the only valid case is when y=z=2, x=5.75, giving S=41.0625, space diagonal≈6.257, radius≈3.128.

Therefore, the minimal r is sqrt(657)/8≈3.128.

But 657 and 8: 657 divided by 8 is 82.125, which is not integer.

Wait, but 657= 3*13*17, and 8 is 2^3, so they are co-prime.

Thus, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64.

Therefore, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Wait, but hold on.

Wait, no, r= sqrt(S)/2= sqrt(657/16)/2= sqrt(657)/4 /2= sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, no, hold on, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, so r= sqrt(657)/8.

Thus, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64.

Yes, so r squared is 657/64, so p=657, q=64, which are co-prime since 657=3*13*17, 64=2^6, no common factors.

Thus, p+q=657+64=721.

Therefore, the answer is 721.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{721}
</think>

Given a set \(\mathcal{B}\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The value of \(r^2\) can be written as \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to find \(p + q\).

First, we denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The surface area constraint is \(2(xy + yz + xz) = 54\), which simplifies to \(xy + yz + xz = 27\). The volume constraint is \(xyz = 23\).

To find the smallest sphere that can contain the box, the space diagonal of the box must be less than or equal to the diameter of the sphere. The space diagonal is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\). Therefore, the radius \(r\) of the sphere must be at least half of this space diagonal.

We aim to maximize \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\) subject to the constraints \(xy + yz + xz = 27\) and \(xyz = 23\). Using the method of Lagrange multipliers and considering the symmetry and constraints, we find that the maximum space diagonal occurs when two dimensions are equal.

Assuming \(x = y\), we solve the equations:
1. \(2x^2 + 2xz = 27\)
2. \(x^2 z = 23\)

From the volume constraint, we get \(z = \frac{23}{x^2}\). Substituting this into the surface area constraint, we solve the cubic equation \(x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0\). The roots of this equation give us the dimensions of the box. The valid root for \(x\) is 2, leading to \(z = 5.75\).

The space diagonal is then calculated as:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4 + 33.0625} = \sqrt{41.0625} = \sqrt{\frac{657}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{4}
\]

The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half of this space diagonal:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}
\]

Thus, \(r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{64}\). The fraction \(\frac{657}{64}\) is in its simplest form, so \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\). Therefore, \(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
