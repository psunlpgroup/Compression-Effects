Okay, so I need to figure out who the president of the newly declared independent country called the Alabio–Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship is. Hmm, I'm not familiar with this country, so I'll have to break it down.

First, the name is a bit long: Alabio–Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship. It sounds like a commission or organization rather than a country itself. Maybe it's a group formed after some historical events. I know that Timor-Leste is the official name of East Timor, which was a colony of Portugal and then invaded by Indonesia. There was a lot of violence and a commission was set up to investigate the violence, known as the Commission of Truth and Friendship.

Wait, so is this Commission of Truth and Friendship actually a country? Or is it a commission within a country? I think it's the latter. It was established to look into the past events where many people were killed or went missing. The commission's role is to uncover the truth about the violence and promote reconciliation.

So, the question is about the president of this commission. I believe the president of the Commission of Truth and Friendship is a respected figure in East Timor. I've heard of Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo before. He's a Nobel laureate and played a significant role in the commission. He's known for his work in promoting human rights and peace.

I should double-check if the commission is recognized as an independent country, but I think it's more of an institution within East Timor. So the president of the commission would be Bishop Belo. He's the one who's been leading this initiative for many years.

Putting it all together, the president of the Alabio–Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship is Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo.
