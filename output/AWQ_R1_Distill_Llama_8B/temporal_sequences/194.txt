Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Sarah could have gone to the dance studio. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how the times overlap.

First, Sarah woke up at 5am. That's a good starting point.

Next, Susan saw Sarah buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. So, between 5am and 7am, Sarah was at the store buying a phone.

Then, Emily saw Sarah playing tennis at the tennis court from 7am to 11am. So, after 7am, Sarah was occupied with playing tennis until 11am.

After that, Thomas saw Sarah sitting on a rooftop from 1pm to 6pm. That means from 1pm to 6pm, Sarah was on the rooftop.

The dance studio was closed after 6pm. So, after 6pm, the dance studio wasn't open.

Now, we need to find the possible times when Sarah could have gone to the dance studio without overlapping her other activities.

Let's look at her schedule:

- **5am to 7am**: At the electronics store.
- **7am to 11am**: Playing tennis.
- **1pm to 6pm**: On the rooftop.

From the above, Sarah was busy from 5am until 11am, and then again from 1pm to 6pm.

But the dance studio was closed after 6pm, so the latest she could have gone is before 6pm.

However, there's a gap between 11am and 1pm. Let me check that. Between 11am and 1pm, she wasn't doing anything mentioned here. So, that's a free window.

But wait, from 1pm to 6pm, she was on the rooftop. So, she couldn't have gone to the dance studio then because she was occupied.

So, the only possible time she could have gone is between 11am and 1pm.

But let me double-check. From 5am to 7am, she was at the store. Then 7am to 11am, tennis. So, 11am to 1pm is when she's free.

And after 6pm, the studio is closed, so she couldn't have gone then.

Therefore, the only available time is between 11am and 1pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 1pm to 6pm – She was on the rooftop, so no.
(B) 7am to 11am – She was playing tennis.
(C) 5am to 7am – She was buying a phone.
(D) 11am to 1pm – This fits the free time.

So, the correct answer is (D).

**Answer: (D)**
