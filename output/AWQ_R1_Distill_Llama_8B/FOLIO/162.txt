Okay, so I have this logic problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it properly. The premise says, "A hawk never swims." Then it states, "Some birds are hawks." And the conclusion is, "All birds swim." I need to figure out if this conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the premises.

Alright, let's break it down. First, the premise tells me that hawks don't swim. So, if I see a hawk, it won't be in the water. That makes sense because I know hawks are birds of prey, and they don't swim; they fly. So the first statement is clear.

Next, the second premise says some birds are hawks. So, there exists at least one type of bird that is a hawk. That means the set of birds includes hawks, but not all birds are hawks, right? Because it's using "some," not "all." So, it's like saying within the category of birds, there's a subset that are hawks.

Now, the conclusion is that all birds swim. Hmm, that's a strong statement. Let me see if that follows logically from the premises.

So, if I have some birds that are hawks, and hawks never swim, does that mean all birds don't swim? Wait, no. Because not all birds are hawks. So, the fact that some birds are hawks and those hawks don't swim doesn't necessarily tell me anything about the other birds that aren't hawks. Maybe those other birds do swim, maybe they don't. The premises don't provide information about non-hawks.

So, the conclusion that all birds swim isn't necessarily true because we don't know about the non-hawk birds. They could swim, they could not. The premises don't give us enough information to conclude that all birds swim.

Wait, let me think again. The premises are:

1. A hawk never swims.
2. Some birds are hawks.

From 1, we know hawks don't swim. From 2, we know there exists at least one bird (the hawks) that don't swim. But the conclusion is that all birds swim, which would require that every single bird is a non-swimmer. But since some birds are hawks, and hawks don't swim, that doesn't mean all birds don't swim. It's possible that other birds do swim.

So, the conclusion is making a universal statement about all birds, but the premises only give information about a subset (hawks). Therefore, the conclusion can't be definitively true because we don't know about the rest of the birds. It's uncertain.

Alternatively, if the conclusion were that "No birds swim," that would make sense because if some birds are hawks and hawks don't swim, then those hawks don't swim. But since not all birds are hawks, we can't say that no birds swim. The conclusion that all birds swim is the opposite of that.

Wait, no, the conclusion is that all birds swim, which is a positive statement. But from the premises, we can't conclude anything about all birds swimming or not. We can only say that some birds (hawks) don't swim, but we don't know about the others. So, the conclusion that all birds swim is making an assumption that isn't supported by the premises.

Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain because we don't have enough information about all birds. The only thing we know is that some birds (hawks) don't swim, but we don't know about the others.

I think that's the correct reasoning. The premises don't provide sufficient information to conclude that all birds swim, so the conclusion is uncertain.
</think>

The conclusion that all birds swim is uncertain based on the given premises. The premises only establish that hawks, which are some birds, do not swim. However, they do not provide information about other birds, so we cannot definitively conclude that all birds swim.

**Answer:** The conclusion is uncertain.
