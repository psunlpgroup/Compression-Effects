Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion that St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state is true or false based on the given premises. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, the premise states that Billings is a city in Montana, a state in the U.S. Then it mentions that Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula. So, all these cities—Billings, Butte, Helena, Missoula—are in Montana.

Next, it says that White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state. Since Butte is already in Montana, that means White Sulphur Springs is also in Montana. Got it.

Then, it specifies that St Pierre is not in Montana. So, St Pierre is in another state. Also, any city in Butte is not in St Pierre. That makes sense because they're different cities, so St Pierre isn't a part of Butte, and vice versa.

Now, an important point is that a city can only be in one state in the U.S., except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City. These four cities are exceptions because they straddle two states. For example, Bristol is in both Virginia and Tennessee, Texarkana is in Texas and Arkansas, Texhoma is in Texas and Oklahoma, and Union City is in Tennessee and Missouri.

So, putting it all together: St Pierre is not in Montana, so it must be in another state. Now, the conclusion is that St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state. Let's see if that's possible.

I know that Bismarck is a city. I'm not immediately sure which state it's in, but I can figure it out. Since the exceptions are Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City, Bismarck isn't one of those. So, Bismarck must be in only one state.

Now, considering that St Pierre is not in Montana and Bismarck isn't one of the four exceptions, we need to check if they are in the same state.

Wait, but do we have any information about where Bismarck is located? The premises don't directly state where Bismarck is. Let me think. The premises mention Butte, Helena, Missoula, Billings, White Sulphur Springs, and St Pierre, but not Bismarck.

So, based on the premises, I don't have any direct information about Bismarck's state. The only thing I know is that St Pierre is not in Montana. Since Bismarck isn't one of the four cities that span two states, it's likely in a single state, but we don't know which one.

Therefore, without knowing where Bismarck is, we can't determine if it's in the same state as St Pierre. The conclusion assumes that Bismarck is in the same state as St Pierre, but there's no premise supporting that Bismarck is in a specific state, let alone the same one as St Pierre.

So, the conclusion might be jumping to a conclusion without sufficient evidence from the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain based on the given information.
</think>

The conclusion that St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state is uncertain because there is no information provided about Bismarck's location relative to St Pierre. The premises only indicate that St Pierre is not in Montana but do not specify Bismarck's state or its relation to St Pierre.

Answer: Uncertain
