To determine the possible times David could have visited the dance studio, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **David's Wake-Up Time**: David woke up at 5am.

2. **Betty's Observation**: Betty saw David playing tennis at the tennis court from 5am to 8am. This means David was occupied at the tennis court during this period.

3. **Anthony's Observation**: Anthony saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 11am. So, David was occupied in this area during this time.

4. **Lisa's Observation**: Lisa saw David taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 12pm to 5pm. This indicates that David was occupied in this location during this time.

5. **Studio Closing Time**: The dance studio was closed after 5pm.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- **From 5am to 8am**: David was playing tennis, so he couldn't have been at the dance studio.
- **From 8am to 11am**: David was walking towards the Statue of Liberty, so he couldn't have been at the dance studio.
- **From 12pm to 5pm**: David was taking photos near the Eiffel Tower, so he couldn't have been at the dance studio during this time either.
  
Since the dance studio was closed after 5pm, and David was occupied throughout the day, there is no available time for him to visit the dance studio.

**Conclusion**: There is no time between the given observations when David could have visited the dance studio.

**Final Answer**: (D) 8am to 11am
