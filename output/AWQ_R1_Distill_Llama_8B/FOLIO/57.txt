Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the conclusion "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me start by listing out all the facts provided.

First, the premise says that Billings is a city in the state of Montana in the U.S. That's straightforward. So Montana is a state, and Billings is one of its cities.

Next, it mentions that the state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula. So Butte is a city in Montana. That's clear.

Then, it states that White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in the U.S. So both White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities, and they're in the same state. Since we already know Butte is in Montana, that must mean White Sulphur Springs is also in Montana.

Moving on, it says the city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana. So St Pierre is a different state from Montana.

Then, it adds that any city in Butte is not in St Pierre. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Does it mean that any city named Butte is not in St Pierre? Or does it mean that any city in Butte (as a place) is not in St Pierre? I think it's the latter, meaning that the city of Butte is not in St Pierre. Since Butte is in Montana, and St Pierre is not in Montana, this makes sense.

Finally, it mentions that a city can only be in one state in the U.S., except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City. These four cities are exceptions because they straddle multiple states or maybe even countries. But in this case, we're dealing with U.S. states, so these four cities are each in two or more states. But for our case, we're focusing on U.S. states, so each city is typically in one state, except those four.

Now, looking at the conclusion: Butte and St Pierre are in the same state. From the premises, Butte is in Montana, and St Pierre is not in Montana. So they can't be in the same state because St Pierre is in a different state. Also, since St Pierre is not in Montana, and Butte is, they can't be in the same state. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

The conclusion that "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state" is **false**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Butte's State:** Butte is a city in the state of Montana (as stated in the premise).

2. **St Pierre's State:** The premise explicitly mentions that St Pierre is not in Montana.

3. **Same State Requirement:** For two cities to be in the same state, they must both be within that state's boundaries.

4. **Conclusion Analysis:** Since Butte is in Montana and St Pierre is not, they cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
