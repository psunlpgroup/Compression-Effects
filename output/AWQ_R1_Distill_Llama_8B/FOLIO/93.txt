Okay, so I need to figure out if Tom is allowed to move into the Olive Garden apartment with his cat Fluffy. Let's break down the premises step by step.

First, the premise says that pets are allowed in some managed buildings. That means it's possible, but not necessarily everywhere. So, it's a starting point.

Next, a deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more. So, the deposit is at least as much as the rent, but could be more.

Now, Fluffy is Tom's cat, and cats are pets. So, Fluffy is a pet, and Tom has a pet. That's relevant because the first premise mentions pets.

The Olive Garden is a managed building, which is important because it tells us where we're evaluating the situation. The monthly rent there is $2000, and this is more than $1500. So, the rent is higher than $1500.

Tom will rent an apartment if he's allowed to move in with Fluffy and the security deposit is no more than $1500. So, two conditions must be met for Tom to rent: permission to have a pet and a security deposit not exceeding $1500.

Now, putting it all together. The Olive Garden is a managed building, so the deposit rules apply. The rent is $2000, which is more than $1500. So, the security deposit must be at least $2000 because it's equal to or more than the rent. 

But Tom's condition is that the deposit is no more than $1500. Since the required deposit is at least $2000, it's more than $1500. Therefore, Tom's condition isn't met. So, he can't rent because the security deposit is higher than what he's willing to pay.

Wait, but the first premise says pets are allowed in some managed buildings. So, does that mean the Olive Garden allows pets? Or is it just that some do, not necessarily all? The premise doesn't specify that the Olive Garden allows pets, only that in some managed buildings, they do. So, we don't know if the Olive Garden specifically allows pets. That's an uncertainty.

If the Olive Garden does allow pets, then the next part is about the deposit. Since the rent is $2000, the deposit must be at least that. So, the deposit is $2000 or more, which is more than $1500. Therefore, Tom's condition requires the deposit to be no more than $1500, which isn't met. So, he can't rent.

But if the Olive Garden doesn't allow pets, then Tom can't move in with Fluffy regardless of the deposit. So, the conclusion would be false.

However, the first premise only states that some managed buildings allow pets, not that all do. So, we don't know for sure if the Olive Garden allows pets. Therefore, it's uncertain whether Tom is allowed to move in because we don't know if the building allows pets, and even if it does, the deposit is too high.

So, the conclusion is uncertain because there are two unknowns: whether the building allows pets and whether the security deposit meets Tom's condition.
</think>

The conclusion is uncertain because while the Olive Garden is a managed building, we don't know if it allows pets. Even if it does, the required security deposit exceeds $1500, which is a condition Tom can't meet. Therefore, the outcome hinges on two unknown factors, making the conclusion uncertain.

**Answer:** The conclusion is uncertain.
