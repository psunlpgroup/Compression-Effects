Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the coffee shop based on the information provided. I'll go through each step carefully to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, let's list out all the times when William was seen by different people:

1. **Susan**: William was at the library from **6am to 9am**.
2. **Linda**: William was at the airport from **9am to 3pm**.
3. **Mark**: William was playing tennis at the tennis court from **4pm to 6pm**.
4. **Samantha**: William was at the office from **6pm to 9pm**.
5. **Ashley**: William was working out at the gym from **9pm to 10pm**.

Additionally, the **coffee shop was closed after 10pm**, which might be important.

Now, let's analyze William's schedule:

- From **6am to 9am**: He was at the library with Susan.
- From **9am to 3pm**: He was at the airport with Linda.
- From **3pm to 4pm**: There's a gap here because Linda saw him at the airport until 3pm, and Mark saw him at the tennis court starting at 4pm. So, between 3pm and 4pm, William must have moved from the airport to the tennis court.
  
  However, during this time, William could have gone to the coffee shop. Let's check the options:

  **Option A: 3pm to 4pm**
  
  This is a possible time because William was traveling from the airport to the tennis court, and the coffee shop was likely open during this period (since it's only closed after 10pm). So, William could have stopped at the coffee shop between 3pm and 4pm.

  **Option B: 4pm to 6pm**
  
  Mark saw William playing tennis from 4pm to 6pm. This means William was busy playing tennis during this time. Therefore, he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this period.

  **Option C: 6pm to 9pm**
  
  Samantha saw William at the office from 6pm to 9pm. This means William was busy working during this time. He couldn't have gone to the coffee shop.

  **Option D: 9am to 3pm**
  
  Linda saw William at the airport from 9am to 3pm. During this entire period, William was at the airport, so he couldn't have gone to the coffee shop.

  So, the only possible time William could have gone to the coffee shop is **Option A: 3pm to 4pm**.
  
  Just to double-check, let's make sure there's no overlap or conflicting information. William was at the airport until 3pm, then moved to the tennis court by 4pm. Since the coffee shop was closed after 10pm, and he didn't have any other commitments between 3pm and 4pm, this seems like the only feasible time.

  Therefore, the correct answer is **Option A: 3pm to 4pm**.
  
  **Final Answer**
  \boxed{A}
