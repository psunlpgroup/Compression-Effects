Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Jennifer could have gone to the restaurant. I'll start by listing out all the information provided and then analyze it step by step.

First, Jennifer's day starts at 6 AM when she wakes up. So, her day begins at 6 AM.

Next, Mary saw Jennifer driving to the water park from 6 AM to 11 AM. This means Jennifer was at the water park during this time. So, between 6 AM and 11 AM, Jennifer was occupied at the water park.

Then, Sarah saw Jennifer reading at the library from 1 PM to 5 PM. This tells us that after the water park visit, Jennifer went to the library and was there from 1 PM to 5 PM.

After that, David saw Jennifer stretching at a yoga studio from 5 PM to 6 PM. So, right after the library visit, Jennifer went to the yoga studio for an hour.

Finally, Michael saw Jennifer watching a movie at the theater from 6 PM to 10 PM. This indicates that after the yoga studio, Jennifer went to the theater and stayed there until 10 PM.

Now, the restaurant was closed after 10 PM, which means Jennifer could not have gone to the restaurant after 10 PM because the restaurant was already closed.

So, let's piece this together:

- From 6 AM to 11 AM: Water Park
- 11 AM to 1 PM: Jennifer is presumably not at the water park, so she might have gone elsewhere, like the restaurant.
- From 1 PM to 5 PM: Library
- From 5 PM to 6 PM: Yoga Studio
- From 6 PM to 10 PM: Theater

Since the restaurant was closed after 10 PM, Jennifer couldn't have gone to the restaurant after that time.

So, the only possible window when Jennifer could have gone to the restaurant is between 11 AM and 1 PM.

Looking at the options provided:

(A) 1pm to 5pm  
(B) 11am to 1pm  
(C) 6am to 11am  
(D) 5pm to 6pm

The correct time when Jennifer could have gone to the restaurant is between 11 AM and 1 PM.

The correct answer is (B) 11am to 1pm.

**Answer:** (B)
