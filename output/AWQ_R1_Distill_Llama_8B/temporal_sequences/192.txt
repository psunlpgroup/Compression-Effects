Okay, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the restaurant. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.

First, William woke up at 11am. That's his starting point. Now, let's look at what other people saw William doing during the day.

Nancy saw William buying clothes at the mall from 3pm to 5pm. So, between 3pm and 5pm, he was shopping at the mall. That means during that time, he wasn't at the restaurant because he was busy shopping.

Leslie saw William buying a phone at the electronics store from 5pm to 7pm. So, after 5pm, he was at the electronics store buying a phone. That means he wasn't at the restaurant during that time either.

David saw William playing tennis at the tennis court from 7pm to 10pm. So, from 7pm to 10pm, he was playing tennis. The restaurant was closed after 10pm, so he couldn't have gone to the restaurant after that.

Putting this all together, William was:
- From 11am to 3pm: Just woke up, so probably at home or doing something else.
- From 3pm to 5pm: At the mall buying clothes.
- From 5pm to 7pm: At the electronics store buying a phone.
- From 7pm to 10pm: Playing tennis.

So, when could he have gone to the restaurant? It seems like the only time when he wasn't doing any of those activities is between waking up at 11am and going to the mall at 3pm. But wait, he was at home from 11am to 3pm. Did he go out during that time? Well, the only time he was free was from 11am to 3pm, but he was at home, so maybe he went out later. But then, he went to the mall from 3pm to 5pm. So, the restaurant was closed after 10pm, but he was playing tennis until 10pm, so he didn't have time to go to the restaurant after that.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. The restaurant was closed after 10pm, but William was at the tennis court from 7pm to 10pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the restaurant during that time. But before 3pm, he was at home from 11am to 3pm. Maybe he went to the restaurant during that time.

Wait, but Nancy saw him at the mall from 3pm to 5pm, so he was definitely there then. So, before 3pm, he was at home. So, he could have gone to the restaurant between 11am and 3pm.

But wait, the options don't include 11am to 3pm as a possible time for the restaurant. Let me check the options again.

Options:
(A) 3pm to 5pm
(B) 11am to 3pm
(C) 5pm to 7pm
(D) 7pm to 10pm

So, option B is 11am to 3pm, which is when William was at home. So, he could have gone to the restaurant during that time.

But wait, the timeline says he was at the mall from 3pm to 5pm, which is after the time when he could have gone to the restaurant. So, the restaurant was closed after 10pm, but he was at the tennis court until 10pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the restaurant after 7pm because he was playing tennis.

Therefore, the only possible time he could have gone to the restaurant is between 11am and 3pm when he was at home.

So, the correct answer should be option (B) 11am to 3pm.

The correct answer is (B) 11am to 3pm.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. William wakes up at 11am.
2. From 11am to 3pm, he is at home.
3. At 3pm, he goes to the mall and stays there until 5pm.
4. From 5pm to 7pm, he buys a phone at the electronics store.
5. From 7pm to 10pm, he plays tennis.
6. The restaurant is closed after 10pm, so he can't go after 7pm.
7. Therefore, the only time William could have gone to the restaurant is between 11am and 3pm when he was at home.
