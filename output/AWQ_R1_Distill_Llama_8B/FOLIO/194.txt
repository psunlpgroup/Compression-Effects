Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, the premise says that the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer. That's clear. Steinhauer definitely participated in that tournament because it's stated right there. 

Now, there's a six-way tie on the leaderboard. Hmm, a tie means multiple people sharing the same position, right? So, six different people are tied at some position in the leaderboard. The premise also mentions that one person in this six-way tie is from Belgium. So, out of these six, one is Belgian. 

Then, it says that Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard. Okay, so Descampe is a Belgian participant who made it to the leaderboard. The next point is that all people on the leaderboard participated in the tournament. So, if someone is on the leaderboard, they were part of the event. 

Putting this together, since Descampe is on the leaderboard, he participated in the tournament. The six-way tie includes one Belgian, and we know that Steinhauer won the tournament. But does that mean Descampe is part of the six-way tie? 

Wait, the conclusion is that Descampe is in the six-way tie. But the premise only says that one person in the six-way tie is from Belgium. It doesn't specify if that person is Descampe or someone else. So, Descampe is on the leaderboard, but we don't know if he's in the tie or not. 

Also, Steinhauer won, so he's definitely not tied. The six-way tie is separate from the winner. So, Descampe could be either in the tie or not. There's no direct link provided that connects Descampe to the six-way tie specifically, only that he's on the leaderboard and from Belgium. 

Therefore, based on the given information, we can't definitively say Descampe is in the six-way tie. It's possible, but it's not certain. There might be other Belgians on the leaderboard who aren't part of the tie. So, the conclusion is uncertain because we don't have enough information to confirm whether Descampe is in the tie or not.
