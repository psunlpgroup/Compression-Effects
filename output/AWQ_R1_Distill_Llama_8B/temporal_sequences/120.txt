Alright, let's try to figure out when Andrew could have gone to the clothing store. I'll start by laying out all the information given.

Andrew wakes up at 5am. So, his activities probably start around that time.

William saw Andrew playing tennis at the tennis court from 5am to 6am. Okay, so between 5 and 6 am, Andrew was playing tennis.

Next, Jessica saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli from 6am to 9am. So, from 6 am to 9 am, he was at the deli.

Tiffany saw Andrew taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 9am to 11am. So, that's another activity from 9 am to 11 am.

John saw Andrew waiting at the train station from 11am to 5pm. Hmm, that's a longer periodâ€”11 am to 5 pm.

Sarah saw Andrew reading at the library from 6pm to 9pm. So, from 6 pm to 9 pm, he was at the library.

Now, the clothing store was closed after 9 pm. That means the latest Andrew could have gone there is before 9 pm.

Looking at the activities, from 5 am to 9 pm, Andrew was either playing tennis, buying lunch, taking photos, waiting at the train station, or reading. 

So, when could he have gone to the clothing store? It has to be a time when he wasn't doing one of these activities.

Let's see:

- From 5 am to 6 am: playing tennis
- 6 am to 9 am: buying lunch
- 9 am to 11 am: taking photos
- 11 am to 5 pm: waiting at the train station
- 6 pm to 9 pm: reading

The only time not covered in these activities is between 5 pm and 6 pm. Because after 5 pm, he was waiting at the train station until 5 pm, and then at 6 pm, he started reading.

So, the only window when he wasn't doing any of those specific activities is from 5 pm to 6 pm.

Wait, but let me double-check. The clothing store was closed after 9 pm, so he must have gone before 9 pm.

Looking again:

From 5 am to 5 pm, he was either playing tennis, buying lunch, taking photos, or waiting at the train station.

From 5 pm to 6 pm, he wasn't doing any of those specific things mentioned. So that's when he could have gone to the clothing store.

So, the correct time is from 5 pm to 6 pm.

Looking at the options, that's option (D).

I think that makes sense because the clothing store was closed after 9 pm, so he had to go before that. The only free time he had was between 5 pm and 6 pm.

Andrew could have gone to the clothing store between **5pm to 6pm**.
