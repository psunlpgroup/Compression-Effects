Lady Godiva, also known as Godiva of Leicestershire, was an English noblewoman and the wife of Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt. She is best remembered for the legendary story of her riding a horse through a public bath in Leicester, though this tale is not historically verified.

Her birthplace, Leicestershire, was abolished as a ceremonial county in 1972, but this has no direct connection to Lady Godiva herself. The abolition of the ceremonial counties was part of the Local Government Act 1972, which restructured local government in England and Wales.

So, Lady Godiva's birthplace, Leicestershire, was abolished in 1972.
