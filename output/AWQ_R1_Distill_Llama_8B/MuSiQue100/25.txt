Alright, let's try to figure out this question. It's a bit of a tongue-twister, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions "state A" where "Storm of the Century" was filmed. So, I need to find out which state that is. I know "Storm of the Century" is a TV show, and I recall it's based on the book by a specific author. The book's author is mentioned in the question, but it's hidden in a riddle.

The next clue is that the author also wrote a short story featuring the author of "This Is My God." That seems a bit confusing, but I'll try to untangle it. Let's parse it:

1. There's an author who wrote a short story.
2. That short story features the author of "This Is My God."

So, the author of "This Is My God" is a character in a short story written by another author.

Now, connecting this back to the first part: the author of "Storm of the Century" wrote a book, and this book's author is the same as the one who wrote the short story that features the author of "This Is My God."

Putting it all together, the author of "Storm of the Century" wrote a book where the main character is the author of "This Is My God." I think the author in question here is Bret Ray Brown, who wrote "This Is My God." So, Bret Ray Brown also wrote "Storm of the Century," and in that book, he features himself as the author of "This Is My God."

Therefore, the state A where "Storm of the Century" was filmed is based on this information. Since Bret Ray Brown is from Missouri, and the show is based on his life, the state A is likely Missouri.

So, the population of state A, which is Missouri, is approximately 6,093,580 people.
