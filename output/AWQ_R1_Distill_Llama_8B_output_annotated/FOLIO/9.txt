["initializing"] Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the problem is about Tom and the different types of wild turkeys. ["adding-knowledge"] There are six types mentioned: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, Rio Grande, and Ocellated wild turkeys. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From the premises, we know several things about Tom. First, Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey. That's clear. ["deduction"] Also, he's not an Osceola wild turkey. ["deduction"] So, already, we can eliminate two types. ["deduction"] Next, it says Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey. ["deduction"] So, that's another one off the list. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, the premise states that Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey. ["deduction"] So, that eliminates two more types. ["deduction"] So far, we've eliminated four types: Eastern, Osceola, Gould’s, Merriam’s, and Rio Grande. ["deduction"] That leaves only one type remaining, which is Ocellated wild turkey. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Additionally, the premise tells us that Tom is a wild turkey. ["deduction"] Since all the types listed are wild turkeys, ["deduction"] and we've eliminated all except Ocellated, it must be that Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] I think that's it. ["uncertainty-estimation"] There are no other possibilities left, ["deduction"] so logically, Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey. ["end-section"]
