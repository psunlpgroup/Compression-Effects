Alright, let's try to figure out when Samantha could have gone to the amusement park. So, Samantha's day started pretty early. She woke up at 5 am. Then, Hannah saw her buying a phone at the electronics store from 5 am to 7 am. That means Samantha was at the electronics store during that time.

Next, James saw her working out at the gym from 7 am to 8 am. So, after buying the phone, she went to the gym. That makes sense.

Then, Richard saw her working at the office from 8 am to 11 am. So, after the gym, she went to work at the office. That's a typical workday.

Mark saw Samantha buying lunch at the deli from 11 am to 2 pm. So, she must have left the office around 11 am or a bit after, bought lunch, and then... Well, she didn't go to the amusement park yet. The amusement park was closed after 8 pm, so she must have gone later.

William saw her buying a bike at the bike shop from 7 pm to 8 pm. So, after the park was closed, she went to buy a bike. That means she didn't go to the amusement park before 8 pm because the park was already closed.

So, let's piece this together:

- 5 am to 7 am: Electronics store
- 7 am to 8 am: Gym
- 8 am to 11 am: Office
- 11 am to 2 pm: Lunch
- Then, she didn't go to the park yet, because the park was closed by 8 pm.
- 7 pm to 8 pm: Bike shop

So, the time when she could have gone to the amusement park is when she wasn't doing anything else. She was free after 2 pm and before 7 pm because she went to the bike shop at 7 pm.

So, the possible time she could have gone is from 2 pm to 7 pm.

Looking at the options, that's option (A).

The correct answer is (A) 2pm to 7pm.
