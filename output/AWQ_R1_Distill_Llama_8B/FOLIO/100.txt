Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me take it step by step.

First, the premise says that animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. So, every animal falls into one of those two categories. That's clear.

Next, it states that all animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. Wait, but not all animals with backbones are vertebrates, right? Because invertebrates can also have backbones? Hmm, no, actually, invertebrates don't have backbones. Vertebrates do. So, all animals with backbones are vertebrates. So, that premise is actually saying that all vertebrates reproduce by male-and-female mating. That makes sense because most animals that have backbones, like humans, reproduce that way.

Then, it says all vertebrate animals have a backbone. Yeah, that's consistent with the first point. So, the premise is establishing a link between being a vertebrate and having a backbone.

Moving on, all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. So, bees are an example of an animal that doesn't reproduce in that traditional way. Bees reproduce through something else, maybe cloning or laying eggs without males? I'm not entirely sure, but the premise says so, so I have to go with that.

All queen bees are bees. That seems straightforward. Queen bees are a specific type of bee, so this is a subset.

Harry is a bee. So, Harry is definitely a bee, which makes him an invertebrate because, as per the premise, animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. Bees are in the invertebrate category because they don't have a backbone.

Now, looking at the conclusion: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.

Wait, let me parse that. The conclusion is a conditional statement. It says that if Harry is either both a vertebrate and has a backbone, or if he is neither a vertebrate nor has a backbone, then he's neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.

But hold on, from the premises, Harry is a bee. Bees are invertebrates, so Harry is an invertebrate. Also, since Harry is a bee, he's not a queen bee unless he's the queen. But the premise says all queen bees are bees, but it doesn't specify if Harry is a queen bee or just a regular bee.

So, the conclusion is saying that if Harry is a vertebrate with a backbone or neither, then he's neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee. But since Harry is a bee, he's an invertebrate. Therefore, the first part of the conclusion doesn't apply because he can't be a vertebrate. So, the only way the conclusion holds is if he's neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone. But since he's a bee, he's an invertebrate, so he does have a backbone? Wait, no, invertebrates don't have backbones. So, wait, if Harry is a bee, he's an invertebrate, so he doesn't have a backbone. Therefore, he's neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone. That makes the condition true because he's in the second part: neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone.

But then the conclusion says he's neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee. But Harry is an invertebrate, so the conclusion would be saying he's not an invertebrate, which is false. Because he is an invertebrate. So, the conclusion is making a statement that Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee. But since he's an invertebrate, that part is false.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure this:

Premise 1: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. So, all animals are in one of those two groups.

Premise 2: All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. Since animals with backbones are vertebrates, this means all vertebrates reproduce that way.

Premise 3: All vertebrate animals have a backbone. So, that's consistent.

Premise 4: All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. So, bees are an example of an invertebrate that doesn't reproduce that way.

Premise 5: All queen bees are bees. So, queen bees are a type of bee.

Harry is a bee.

So, from the premises, Harry is a bee, so he's an invertebrate. Therefore, he doesn't have a backbone, as invertebrates don't. So, he's neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone.

Now, the conclusion says: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and has a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then he's neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.

Since Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, the condition is met. Therefore, according to the conclusion, Harry should be neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.

But wait, Harry is a bee, so he is an invertebrate. Therefore, the conclusion is saying he's not an invertebrate, which is false. So, the conclusion is incorrect because Harry is an invertebrate, so the conclusion that he's neither is false.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is trying to say that if Harry is a vertebrate with a backbone or neither, then he's not an invertebrate or a queen bee. But since Harry is an invertebrate, he doesn't fit the first condition (vertebrate with backbone), so the conclusion applies to the second condition (neither). Therefore, if he's neither, then he's not an invertebrate or a queen bee. But since he is an invertebrate, the conclusion would be saying he's not, which is false.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is trying to say that if Harry meets either condition (vertebrate with backbone or neither), then he must not be an invertee or queen bee. But since he's an invertee, the only way the conclusion holds is if he's not an invertee, which is impossible because he's a bee.

Therefore, the conclusion is false because Harry is an invertee, making the conclusion's assertion incorrect.

The conclusion is **false** because Harry, being a bee, is an invertebrate. The conclusion incorrectly states that Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee, which contradicts his classification as an invertebrate.
