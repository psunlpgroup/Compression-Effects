Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the premise says that all animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. That means any animal falls into one of those two categories. So, Harry is an animal, so he's either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.

Next, it mentions that all animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. Wait, so if an animal has a backbone, it reproduces through this method. Now, all vertebrates have a backbone, right? Because that's what defines a vertebrate. So, if an animal is a vertebrate, it reproduces by male-and-female mating. That makes sense because humans do that, and humans are vertebrates.

Then, it says that all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. Hmm, so bees don't reproduce the way that animals with backbones do. But wait, bees themselvesâ€”are they invertebrates? Yes, because they have an exoskeleton and are not vertebrates. So, their reproduction is different; maybe they lay eggs or something else.

The next point is that all queen bees are bees. So, queen bees are a type of bee. And we know Harry is a bee, so Harry is a queen bee.

Putting this together: Harry is a bee, and therefore, a queen bee. Now, since all queen bees are bees, and all bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, but all animals with backbones (which are vertebrates) do. But wait, are bees vertebrates? No, because they're invertebrates. So, bees don't have backbones, which aligns with the first premise that animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.

So, since Harry is a bee, he's an invertebrate. But the conclusion says Harry is either an invertebrate or a queen bee. Well, he is a queen bee, but he's also an invertebrate because all bees are invertebrates. So, the conclusion is stating both possibilities, but since he's a queen bee, that part is definitely true.

Wait, but the conclusion is specifically saying he's either an invertebrate or a queen bee. Since he's both, the conclusion is accurate. But the question is whether the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the premises.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is trying to say that Harry is either an invertebrate or a queen bee, but since he's a queen bee, which is a type of bee, and bees are invertebrates, so he's an invertebrate. So, the conclusion is correct because he is an invertebrate, making the conclusion true.

I think that's the logical flow. Harry is a bee, so he's an invertebrate, and he's also a queen bee, so the conclusion correctly identifies both possibilities, but since he's a queen bee, which is a specific case, it's accurate.

The conclusion that Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee is true. Harry, being a bee, is indeed an invertebrate and specifically a queen bee. Therefore, the conclusion accurately reflects both aspects of Harry's classification.

**Answer:** True.
