Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the conclusion is that Rock has wings, and I need to determine if that's necessarily true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises.

First, let's list out all the premises provided:

1. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
2. All monkeys are mammals.
3. Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
4. Peter's birds can fly.
5. All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
6. If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
7. Rock is Peter's pet.
8. Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.

Okay, so starting with premise 7: Rock is Peter's pet. So, Rock is one of Peter's pets.

Now, premise 3 says Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. So, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.

Looking at premise 8: Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. So, these are the possibilities for Rock.

If Rock can fly, then premise 6 says if a Peter's pet can fly, it has wings. So, if Rock can fly, then Rock has wings.

Alternatively, if Rock is a bird, then premise 4 says Peter's birds can fly. So, if Rock is a bird, it can fly.

Another alternative is that Rock cannot breathe. But premise 5 says all Peter's pets that are animals can breathe. So, if Rock is a Peter's pet, and it's an animal, it can breathe. But if Rock cannot breathe, then Rock is not an animal, which would contradict premise 1 because premise 1 says that mammals (which are animals) are animals. Wait, premise 1 says all of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. So, mammals are animals, but what about other pets? Well, premise 3 says all pets are either monkeys or birds, both of which are animals. So, all of Peter's pets are animals, including Rock.

So, if Rock is a Peter's pet, it must be an animal. Therefore, Rock cannot not be able to breathe because that would mean Rock is not an animal, which contradicts premise 5. Therefore, Rock can breathe.

So, from premise 8, since Rock cannot not breathe (because it's a Peter's pet and thus an animal), the other options must be considered. So, Rock can fly or Rock is a bird. Because the other option, Rock cannot breathe, is impossible.

So, Rock is either a bird or can fly. If Rock is a bird, then from premise 4, Peter's birds can fly. So, Rock can fly. Alternatively, if Rock can fly, then from premise 6, Rock has wings.

Wait, so if Rock is a bird, it can fly, which would make premise 8's condition true, but also, if Rock can fly, premise 6 applies, giving Rock wings.

So, in either case, Rock can fly, and thus has wings.

Therefore, regardless of whether Rock is a bird or can fly, it must have wings.

So, the conclusion that Rock has wings seems to be necessarily true.
</think>

The conclusion that Rock has wings is necessarily true based on the given premises.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Peter's Pets:** From premise 3, all of Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds. Rock is one of these pets (premise 7).

2. **Rock's Nature:** From premise 8, Rock can fly, is a bird, or cannot breathe. Since Rock is a Peter's pet and all pets are animals (premise 1 and 5), Rock must be able to breathe. Thus, the third option is invalid, leaving Rock either a bird or able to fly.

3. **If Rock is a Bird:** As a bird (premise 4), Rock can fly. Therefore, Rock can fly.

4. **If Rock can Fly:** From premise 6, if a pet can fly, it has wings. Thus, Rock has wings.

5. **Conclusion:** Regardless of whether Rock is a bird or can fly, it must have wings. Hence, Rock necessarily has wings.

**Answer:** The conclusion that Rock has wings is true.
