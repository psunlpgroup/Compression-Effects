Alright, let's try to figure out when Ashley could have gone to the construction site. So, Ashley wakes up at 5 am. Then, James saw Ashley working at the office from 5 am to 9 am. Okay, so that means Ashley was at the office from 5 am to 9 am.

Then, Richard saw Ashley buying a phone at the electronics store from 4 pm to 7 pm. Hmm, so Ashley was buying a phone during that time. But wait, Ashley was already at the office from 5 am to 9 am. So, after 9 am, she must have gone somewhere else, like buying a phone from 4 pm to 7 pm. But there's a gap between 9 am and 4 pm. So, maybe Ashley went to the construction site during that time.

Next, David saw Ashley playing tennis at the tennis court from 7 pm to 8 pm. So, after buying the phone, she played tennis from 7 pm to 8 pm. Then, William saw Ashley watching a movie at the theater from 8 pm to 10 pm. So, after playing tennis, she went to the theater.

The construction site was closed after 10 pm, so she couldn't have gone there after 10 pm.

So, looking at the options:

(A) 4 pm to 7 pm: That's when she was buying a phone. So, she wasn't at the construction site then.

(B) 5 am to 9 am: She was at the office then.

(C) 9 am to 4 pm: That's when she wasn't at the office or the electronics store. Maybe she went to the construction site during that time.

(D) 8 pm to 10 pm: She was at the theater then.

So, the only time she wasn't doing those activities was from 9 am to 4 pm. That's when she could have gone to the construction site.

So, the correct answer is (C).
