Alright, let's try to figure out when Richard could have gone to the amusement park. So, Richard wakes up at 5 am. Then, Mary sees him buying a phone at the electronics store from 11 am to 6 pm. Leslie sees him working out at the gym from 6 pm to 8 pm. Kimberly sees him attending class at the school from 8 pm to 9 pm. Nancy sees him buying cookies at a bakery from 9 pm to 10 pm. The amusement park closes after 10 pm.

Hmm, so we need to find the time window when Richard wasn't doing any of those other activities and could have gone to the amusement park.

First, Richard wakes up at 5 am. But there's no information about what he does right after waking up. So, maybe he was at home or doing something else before 11 am.

Mary saw him from 11 am to 6 pm buying a phone. So, during that time, he's occupied with buying a phone. That means he wasn't at the amusement park during that time.

Leslie saw him working out from 6 pm to 8 pm. So, he's busy at the gym during that hour and a half.

Kimberly saw him attending class from 8 pm to 9 pm. So, he's in school during that time.

Nancy saw him buying cookies from 9 pm to 10 pm. So, he's occupied until 10 pm.

The amusement park closes after 10 pm, so he can't go after that.

Putting this all together:

- 5 am to 11 am: Not sure, but he's up at 5 am, but no one saw him during this time. Maybe he was at home or elsewhere.
- 11 am to 6 pm: He's buying a phone, so he's occupied.
- 6 pm to 8 pm: He's working out.
- 8 pm to 9 pm: He's in class.
- 9 pm to 10 pm: He's buying cookies.

So, the only time he's not seen by anyone is from 5 am to 11 am. That seems like the only window he could have gone to the amusement park.

But wait, the options given are:

(A) 6pm to 8pm
(B) 5am to 11am
(C) 11am to 6pm
(D) 8pm to 9pm

So, option B, 5am to 11am, is the time when he wasn't seen by anyone, so that's when he could have gone to the amusement park.

The correct answer is (B) 5am to 11am.

**Answer:** (B)
