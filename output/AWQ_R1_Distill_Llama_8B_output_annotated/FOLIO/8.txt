["initializing"] Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the conclusion that "Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break this down step by step.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, the premises are: 1. When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. 2. Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. 3. Humans are mammals. 4. Mammals are animals. 5. Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. 6. People feel tired when they get the flu.["end-section"]

["initializing"] So, the conclusion we're evaluating is that coughing is a symptom of Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me start by looking at premise 5: it lists specific symptoms of Monkeypox as fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. There's no mention of coughing here. So, the premise doesn't explicitly state that coughing is a symptom.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Now, premise 6 says that when people get the flu, they feel tired. The flu is another illness, but it's not directly related to Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["deduction"] The connection here might be trying to link tiredness as a symptom common to both, but that doesn't help with the conclusion about coughing.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Premise 1 talks about the Monkeypox virus causing Monkeypox in a being, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't specify what the symptoms are beyond premise 5. So, this premise doesn't add any new symptom information.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Premise 2 mentions that the virus occurs in certain animals.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Since humans are mammals (premise 3) and mammals are animals (premise 4), this tells us that the virus can occur in humans, but again, doesn't add any symptom info.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Putting this all together, the premises don't mention coughing as a symptom of Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] They do mention other symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.["end-section"]

["deduction"] The connection to the flu is about tiredness, which is already noted, but there's no info linking coughing to Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, based solely on the provided premises, there's no evidence that coughing is a symptom of Monkeypox. The conclusion isn't supported by the premises given.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] The conclusion that symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing is **uncertain** because the provided premises do not mention coughing as a symptom of Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] While the premises list other symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness, there is no information linking coughing to Monkeypox.["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Therefore, the evidence insufficient to confirm or deny the conclusion regarding coughing as a symptom.["end-section"]
