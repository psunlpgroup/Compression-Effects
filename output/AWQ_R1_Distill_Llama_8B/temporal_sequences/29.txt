Alright, let's figure out the possible times Hannah could have gone to the beach. 

First, Hannah woke up at 5am. So her day starts at 5am.

Richard saw her on the rooftop from 5am to 7am. That means from 5am to 7am, she was on the rooftop.

Ashley saw her getting coffee from 9am to 7pm. So from 9am to 7pm, she was at the cafe.

Jennifer saw her taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7pm to 8pm.

The beach was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone to the beach after 8pm.

Looking at the times:

- **5am to 7am**: She was on the rooftop, so she wasn't at the beach.

- **7am to 9am**: There's a gap between 7am and 9am where we don't have any information. Maybe she went to the beach during this time.

- **9am to 7pm**: She was at the cafe, so she wasn't at the beach.

- **7pm to 8pm**: She was taking photos, so she wasn't at the beach.

Since the beach was closed after 8pm, she couldn't have gone after 8pm.

So the only possible time she could have gone to the beach is between **7am and 9am**.

Let me double-check:

- From 5am to 7am: Rooftop.

- 7am to 9am: Possible beach time.

- 9am to 7pm: Cafe.

- 7pm to 8pm: Photos.

Beach is closed after 8pm, so no later than 8pm.

Therefore, the only available window is **7am to 9am**.

The options are:

(A) 7pm to 8pm

(B) 7am to 9am

(C) 9am to 7pm

(D) 5am to 7am

So the correct answer is **(B)**.
</think>

The correct answer is **(B) 7am to 9am**.

**Answer:** (B)
