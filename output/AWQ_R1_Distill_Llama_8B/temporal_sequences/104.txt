Alright, let's try to figure out when Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall. So, Anthony wakes up at 6am. Michael saw him stretching at a yoga studio from 6am to 3pm. That means Anthony was at the yoga studio from 6am to 3pm. Then, Sarah saw him taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 3pm to 5pm. So, from 3pm to 5pm, he's taking photos. After that, Elizabeth saw him waiting at the train station from 5pm to 6pm. So, he's at the train station from 5pm to 6pm.

Now, the orchestra hall was closed after 7pm. So, Anthony could have gone to the orchestra hall only before the hall closed, which is by 7pm. Let's see when he was free.

He was at the yoga studio from 6am to 3pm. Then, he took photos from 3pm to 5pm. After that, he was waiting at the train station from 5pm to 6pm. So, after 6pm, he's either at the train station or possibly moving from there. But the orchestra hall was closed after 7pm, so he probably couldn't have gone after 7pm.

Looking at the times he's occupied, from 6am to 3pm (yoga), 3pm to 5pm (photos), and 5pm to 6pm (train station). That leaves us with the time between 6pm and 7pm when he might have gone to the orchestra hall, since the hall closes after 7pm. So, he could have gone between 6pm and 7pm.

Now, let's check the options:

(A) 3pm to 5pm – He was actually taking photos then, not at the orchestra hall.

(B) 6pm to 7pm – This fits because he was free from 6pm to 6pm, and the hall closes after 7pm, so he could have gone then.

(C) 5pm to 6pm – He was at the train station then.

(D) 6am to 3pm – He was at the yoga studio during that time.

So, the correct time is between 6pm and 7pm.
