Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the premise is that taking the GRE test costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. Then, ETS (the company that administers the GRE) provides financial aid to applicants who can prove they have economic hardship. Now, the next point is that people in single-parent families or those with few resources can show this economic hardship. Tom lives in a single-parent family, his dad is out of work, and he has few resources available. So, Tom is applying for the GRE test.

The conclusion is that it costs below $300 to take the GRE test. Wait, but the premise already states that it costs $205, which is indeed below $300. So, is the conclusion just restating the premise? Or is there a logical deduction beyond that?

Hmm, maybe the conclusion is trying to connect the fact that Tom can get financial aid because of his economic situation. So, since Tom can prove economic hardship, he might qualify for financial aid, which could help him afford the test. But the conclusion here is about the cost, not about whether Tom can get aid.

Wait, the premise already tells us the cost is $205, which is below $300. So, the conclusion is actually a restatement of the premise. That would make the conclusion true because it's directly given in the premise. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the conclusion might be inferring that Tom can get aid, thus the cost is manageable. But the conclusion specifically says it costs below $300, which is already stated.

So, perhaps the conclusion is just restating the premise's cost, making it true.

The conclusion is true because it directly restates the premise's information about the GRE test cost being below $300.
