Alright, let's figure out when Sarah could have gone to the clothing store. I'll start by laying out all the information provided.

**Key Points:**
1. **Sarah's Wake-Up Time:** She woke up at 5am.
2. **Thomas's Observation:** He saw Sarah taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from **5am to 7am**.
3. **Betty's Observation:** She saw Sarah sitting on a rooftop from **10am to 4pm**.
4. **William's Observation:** He saw Sarah buying lunch at the deli from **4pm to 9pm**.
5. **Kimberly's Observation:** She saw Sarah getting a coffee at the cafe from **9pm to 10pm**.
6. **Clothing Store Hours:** It was closed after **10pm**.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **From 5am to 7am:** Sarah was taking photos with Thomas. So, she couldn't have gone to the clothing store during this time because she was occupied with taking photos.
  
- **From 7am to 10am:** This is a gap between Thomas's and Betty's observations. Betty saw Sarah on the rooftop starting at 10am. So, Sarah was likely on the rooftop before 10am. Therefore, this time might be when she went to the store.
  
- **From 10am to 4pm:** Betty saw her on the rooftop during this time. So, Sarah was occupied there and couldn't have gone to the store.
  
- **From 4pm to 9pm:** William saw her buying lunch here. She was busy shopping or eating lunch, so she couldn't have gone to the store.
  
- **From 9pm to 10pm:** Kimberly saw her getting coffee. She was occupied until 10pm, but the clothing store closed after 10pm. So, she couldn't have gone to the store during this time.

**Possible Window:**
The only free time Sarah had was between **7am and 10am**. During this period, she wasn't seen by anyone else, and she likely had the opportunity to go to the clothing store.

**Checking the Store's Closing Time:**
The clothing store was closed after 10pm. Since Sarah's last activity was getting coffee from 9pm to 10pm, she couldn't have gone later than 10pm. However, the store was open before 10pm, so she could have gone during her free time before 10pm.

**Final Answer:**
Sarah could have gone to the clothing store between **7am and 10am**.
