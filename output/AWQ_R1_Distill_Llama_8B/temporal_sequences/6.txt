Alright, let's try to figure out during which time Ashley could have gone to the bookstore. I'll need to analyze the timeline step by step.

First, Ashley wakes up at 7am. That's the starting point.

Leslie saw Ashley buying a bike at the bike shop from 11am to 12pm. So, during this time, Ashley was at the bike shop.

Susan saw Ashley working out at the gym from 12pm to 4pm. So, from 12pm to 4pm, Ashley was at the gym.

Elizabeth saw Ashley waiting at the train station from 4pm to 7pm. So, between 4pm and 7pm, Ashley was at the train station.

Emily saw Ashley taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7pm to 9pm. So, during this time, Ashley was taking photos.

The bookstore was closed after 9pm. So, the latest time Ashley could have gone to the bookstore is before 9pm.

Now, let's see when Ashley was not at the bike shop, gym, train station, or taking photos. 

- From 7am to 11am: Ashley was not seen by anyone except possibly at home.
- From 11am to 12pm: Ashley was at the bike shop.
- From 12pm to 4pm: Ashley was at the gym.
- From 4pm to 7pm: Ashley was at the train station.
- From 7pm to 9pm: Ashley was taking photos.

So, the only time when Ashley wasn't occupied as per the observations is between 7am to 11am. Therefore, this is the only possible window when Ashley could have gone to the bookstore.

Options:
(A) 7pm to 9pm
(B) 11am to 12pm
(C) 12pm to 4pm
(D) 7am to 11am

The correct answer is (D) 7am to 11am.

The correct answer is \boxed{D}.
