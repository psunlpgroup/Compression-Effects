Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the market. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.

First, William wakes up at 7am. So, he's up and about from 7am onwards.

Next, it says William was seen working at the office from 7am to 8am. So, he's busy at the office during that time.

Then, Hannah saw William reading at the library from 8am to 3pm. That means he's at the library for a significant chunk of the day.

Susan saw William fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 4pm. So, after the library, he goes to the store.

Leslie saw William getting a coffee at the cafe from 6pm to 9pm. So, after fixing the computer, he stops by the cafe for coffee.

Also, it's important to note that the market was closed after 9pm. That might be relevant because we want to know when William could have gone to the market.

Now, let's piece this together step by step.

William wakes up at 7am. He works at the office from 7am to 8am. So, he's occupied from 7am to 8am.

After that, Hannah sees him at the library from 8am to 3pm. So, he spends a lot of time at the library.

Then, Susan sees him at the electronic store from 3pm to 4pm. So, he goes there after the library.

Leslie sees him getting coffee from 6pm to 9pm. So, after fixing the computer, he goes for coffee.

The market is closed after 9pm, which might mean that the market opens before 9pm, but it's closed after that. So, the market is likely open during the day and closes after 9pm.

Now, we need to figure out when William could have gone to the market. Let's look at the times when he's not occupied elsewhere.

He's at the office from 7am to 8am, then at the library from 8am to 3pm, then at the store from 3pm to 4pm, and then at the cafe from 6pm to 9pm.

So, between 4pm and 6pm, he's free. He's done with the store by 4pm and then goes to the cafe at 6pm. So, between 4pm and 6pm, he could have gone to the market.

Alternatively, is there another time when he's free? Let's check.

From 7am to 8am, he's at the office. From 8am to 3pm, at the library. 3pm to 4pm, at the store. 6pm to 9pm, at the cafe. So, the only free time is between 4pm and 6pm.

Therefore, the only possible time William could have gone to the market is between 4pm and 6pm.
