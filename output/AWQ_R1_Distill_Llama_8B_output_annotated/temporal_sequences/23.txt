["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the art studio. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, William wakes up at 6am. That's his wake-up time. Then, William was seen working out at the gym from 6am to 7am. So, right after waking up, he goes to the gym for an hour.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, Sean saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 12pm. So, that's in the morning, a few hours after he worked out.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, Susan saw William working at the office from 12pm to 8pm. So, in the afternoon, he's at the office.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Nancy saw William buying a bike at the bike shop from 8pm to 10pm. That's in the evening after he left the office.["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The art studio was closed after 10pm. So, William can't have gone there after 10pm.["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, let's see when William isn't accounted for. He wakes up at 6am, works out until 7am. Then, from 7am to 9am, we don't have any information. That's a one-hour gap before Sean sees him taking photos.["end-section"]

["deduction"] From 9am to 12pm, Sean saw him taking photos. Then, from 12pm to 8pm, Susan saw him at the office. After that, from 8pm to 10pm, Nancy saw him buying a bike.["end-section"]

["deduction"] The art studio is closed after 10pm, so William couldn't have gone there after that time.["end-section"]

["deduction"] But between 7am and 9am, he's not doing anything else. That seems like a window where he could have gone to the art studio.["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Wait, but from 7am to 9am, he's not at the gym, not at the office, not taking photos, and not buying a bike. So, he could have gone to the art studio during that time.["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let me check the options. Option D is 7am to 9am, which fits into the gap where he wasn't seen doing anything else.["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the answer should be option D.["end-section"]
