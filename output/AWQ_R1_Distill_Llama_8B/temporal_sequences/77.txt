Okay, let's try to figure out when Jennifer could have gone to the basketball court. So, Jennifer's day starts at 6 am when she wakes up. Then, there are a few different people who saw her doing different things throughout the day. Let's break it down step by step.

First, Thomas saw Jennifer buying a bike at the bike shop from 6 am to 9 am. So, during that time, she was at the bike shop. That means she wasn't at the basketball court during that window.

Next, Samantha saw Jennifer driving to the water park from 9 am to 10 am. So, right after buying the bike, she went to the water park. That also means she wasn't at the basketball court during that time.

Then, Steven saw Jennifer fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10 am to 1 pm. So, from 10 am until 1 pm, she was busy fixing the computer. No basketball court visit during that period.

After that, Mark saw Jennifer stretching at a yoga studio from 3 pm to 5 pm. So, in the late afternoon, she was at the yoga studio. The basketball court was closed after 5 pm, so she couldn't have gone there after 5 pm.

Putting all this together, when could she have gone to the basketball court? Let's see the times when she wasn't seen by anyone:

- From 6 am to 9 am: She was buying a bike.
- From 9 am to 10 am: She was driving to the water park.
- From 10 am to 1 pm: She was fixing the computer.
- From 3 pm to 5 pm: She was stretching at the yoga studio.

So, the only time she wasn't doing those activities is between 1 pm and 3 pm. That's when she could have gone to the basketball court.

Let's double-check the options provided:

(A) 9am to 10am  
She was driving to the water park then, so not possible.

(B) 6am to 9am  
She was buying a bike then, so not possible.

(C) 3pm to 5pm  
She was at the yoga studio then, so not possible.

(D) 1pm to 3pm  
This is the only time she wasn't seen by anyone, so this must be when she went to the basketball court.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D).

Jennifer went to the basketball court between **1pm to 3pm**.

**Answer:** (D)
