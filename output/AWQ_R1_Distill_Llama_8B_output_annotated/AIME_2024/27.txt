Alright, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a certain interior point \(I\) to each of the faces.
["deduction"]
The point \(I\) is such that the distances to all four faces are equal.
["adding-knowledge"]
First, I recall that in a tetrahedron, if a point has equal distances to all four faces, it's called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle.
["example-testing"]
The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, essentially, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.
["adding-knowledge"]
To find the inradius, I remember that the formula is similar to the inradius of a triangle: \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\), where \(V\) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \(S\) is the total surface area.
["deduction"]
So, I need to compute both the volume \(V\) and the total surface area \(S\).
["adding-knowledge"]
But wait, the tetrahedron isn't given with coordinates or edge lengths directly. Instead, it's given with specific edge lengths: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). So, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal.
["deduction"]
I think such a tetrahedron is called "isohedral" or maybe "edge-transitive"? Not entirely sure, but it's definitely a symmetric one.
["backtracking"]
So, maybe I can place it in a coordinate system in such a way that calculations become easier.
["initializing"]
Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.
["backtracking"]
Wait, why? Because if I consider the opposite edges \(AB\) and \(CD\) to be equal, perhaps if I invert the coordinates of \(C\) and \(D\) relative to \(A\) and \(B\), the lengths will be preserved.
["example-testing"]
Alternatively, I remember that in such symmetric tetrahedrons, the coordinates can be placed such that the centroid is at the origin or something.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can use the property that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so the inradius can be calculated via some symmetric properties.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant.
["adding-knowledge"]
[Cayley-Menger Formula Explanation]
["deduction"]
So, plugging in the given edge lengths:
["adding-knowledge"]
Given: - \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\) - \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\) - \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\)
["deduction"]
So, the determinant becomes:
["backtracking"]
That looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit.
["example-testing"]
Notice that the matrix is symmetric with respect to the last three rows.
["backtracking"]
Maybe the determinant can be simplified by taking advantage of this symmetry.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps the determinant can be computed by noticing that the last three rows form a symmetric block.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant by expanding along the first row or column.
["backtracking"]
Then, the rest are 1s multiplied by their respective minors.
["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, this is getting very tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can note that the determinant is symmetric, so perhaps it's equal to something.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that this determinant is equal to (something)^2, but I'm not sure.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can compute this determinant by noticing the pattern.
["backtracking"]
Wait, another thought: The edge lengths are such that \(AB = CD\), \(AC = BD\), \(AD = BC\), so the tetrahedron is "equifacial" in some sense.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with two pairs of opposite edges equal.
["backtracking"]
Wait, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron as a kind of "double" pyramid or something.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can use vector algebra.
["backtracking"]
But this might become too involved. Alternatively, maybe I can use the property that in such a symmetric tetrahedron, the coordinates can be set so that the centroid is at the origin, but I'm not sure.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can note that the edge lengths form a sort of rectangle in some way.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, since the edge lengths are given, perhaps I can compute the volume via the scalar triple product.
["backtracking"]
But for that, I need coordinates, which brings me back to the previous problem.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths.
["adding-knowledge"]
Wait, Cayley-Menger determinant is exactly that.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant using the fact that the matrix is symmetric and maybe can be diagonalized or something.
["backtracking"]
Looking at the matrix:
["example-testing"]
I notice that the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows form a kind of rotational pattern.
["backtracking"]
So, maybe the determinant can be simplified by recognizing this symmetry.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant.
["backtracking"]
Now, perhaps I can do similar operations for columns.
["backtracking"]
But the first column has entries: 0,1,0,0,0.
["backtracking"]
Wait, but that might complicate things.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the first row is all 1s, so perhaps I can perform row operations to create zeros.
["backtracking"]
So, in the minor matrix, first column:
["backtracking"]
Let me compute each:
["backtracking"]
So, the minor matrix now becomes:
["backtracking"]
Now, the first column has only 1 and 0s, so maybe we can expand the determinant along the first column.
["deduction"]
Wait, in the computation of the determinant, maybe I messed up the signs.
["deduction"]
Volume squared = (1/288) * 819,200
["backtracking"]
Wait, where did I mess up?
["uncertainty-estimation"]
Volume squared can't be negative.
["example-testing"]
Yes, that's correct.
["deduction"]
Thus, Volume V = 160/3.
["deduction"]
Next, we compute the total surface area S.
["adding-knowledge"]
Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\).
["deduction"]
So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).
["deduction"]
So, all four faces are congruent triangles?
["example-testing"]
Using Heron's formula:
["backtracking"]
But this is going to be complicated with square roots. Maybe there's a smarter way.
["backtracking"]
Alternatively, notice that the triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89) is a right triangle.
["example-testing"]
Using cosine law:
["example-testing"]
Verify calculations and reasoning.
["deduction"]
Thus, total surface area S = 4 * 6*sqrt(21) =24*sqrt(21)
["deduction"]
S=24√21
["deduction"]
So, inradius r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(24√21)
["deduction"]
So, r= (20/3)/√21
["deduction"]
Rationalize the denominator:
["example-testing"]
Thus, the inradius is 20√21 /63.
["deduction"]
Expressed as m√n /p, m=20, n=21, p=63.
["example-testing"]
Check if m and p are coprime:
["backtracking"]
Yes, they are.
["deduction"]
Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.
["deduction"]
So, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.
["initializing"]
**Final Answer** \boxed{104}
