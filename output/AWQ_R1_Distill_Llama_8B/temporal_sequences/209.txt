Okay, let's try to figure out between what times Tiffany could have gone to the clothing store. 

First, let's list out all the information we have:

1. **Tiffany's schedule:**
   - She woke up at 10am.
   - Between 10am and 12pm, John saw her taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
   - From 1pm to 6pm, William saw her taking photos near the Eiffel Tower.
   - From 6pm to 7pm, Lisa saw her driving to the water park.
   - The clothing store was closed after 7pm.

2. **Important points:**
   - Tiffany was busy from 10am to 6pm.
   - The clothing store was closed after 7pm, so she likely went before 7pm.

Now, let's analyze each time frame:

- **10am to 12pm:** John saw her taking photos. So, she was occupied then.
- **1pm to 6pm:** William saw her taking photos again. So, she was busy during this time too.
- **6pm to 7pm:** Lisa saw her driving to the water park. She was occupied here as well.

Since the clothing store was closed after 7pm, and she was busy until 7pm, she wouldn't have had time to go to the store after 7pm. Therefore, the only free time she had was before 10am, but she just woke up at 10am. That doesn't leave any time for her to go to the store.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. There must be an overlap or something I'm missing. Let me check again.

She was busy from 10am to 7pm. The clothing store was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone after that. But was there any time before 10am? She just woke up at 10am. So, she didn't have any free time before that.

Hmm, maybe I misread the timeline. Let me double-check.

John saw her from 10am to 12pm. William from 1pm to 6pm. Lisa from 6pm to 7pm. So, from 10am to 7pm, she was occupied. The clothing store was closed after 7pm, so she couldn't have gone then. But she didn't have any free time before 10am because she just woke up then.

Wait, maybe the store was open before 7pm, and she could have gone between 12pm to 1pm or something.

But John saw her from 10am to 12pm, William from 1pm to 6pm. So, between 12pm and 1pm, she wasn't seen by anyone. Maybe that's when she went to the store.

Yes, that makes sense. She was taking photos until 12pm, then she went to the store, and then William saw her again at 1pm.

So, the time she could have gone is between 12pm to 1pm.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12pm to 1pm.
