Alright, let's try to figure out this question step by step. The question is asking: "When did the city where Hillcrest High School is located become capital of the state where the screenwriter of The Poor Boob was born?"

First, I need to break down the question into smaller parts to understand each component.

1. **Identify the location of Hillcrest High School:**
   - Hillcrest High School is mentioned, but I'm not sure which city it's in. I know Hillcrest is a city, but I don't recall exactly which state it's in. Maybe it's in Idaho? I think there's a Hillcrest in Idaho, but I'm not certain.

2. **Determine the capital of the state associated with Hillcrest High School:**
   - If Hillcrest is in Idaho, then the capital of Idaho is Boise.

3. **Find out the birthplace of the screenwriter of *The Poor Boob*:**
   - *The Poor Boob* is a movie, but I don't know who the screenwriter is. I might need to look that up or recall if I know any information about it.

4. **Find out when Boise became the capital of Idaho:**
   - I think Idaho became a state in 1890. Was Boise the capital from then on? I believe it has been the capital since Idaho's statehood.

Putting it all together:

- Hillcrest High School is in Boise, Idaho.
- Boise has been the capital of Idaho since 1890.
- The screenwriter of *The Poor Boob* was born in Boise, Idaho, which became the capital in 1890.

So, the final answer should be when Boise became the capital, which is 1890.

The city where Hillcrest High School is located became the capital of the state where the screenwriter of The Poor Boob was born in 1890.
