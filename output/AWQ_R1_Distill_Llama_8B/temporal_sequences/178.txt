Alright, let's try to figure out when David could have gone to the market. So, the problem gives us a bunch of information about David's activities throughout the day, and we need to piece together the times when he was free to go to the market.

First, let's list out all the information we have:

1. **David woke up at 5am.**
2. **Sarah saw David reading at the library from 5am to 7am.**
3. **John saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 7am to 10am.**
4. **Tiffany saw David buying a bike at the bike shop from 10am to 12pm.**
5. **William saw David buying a phone at the electronics store from 7pm to 10pm.**
6. **The market was closed after 10pm.**

Our goal is to determine the possible times David could have gone to the market.

Let's start by creating a timeline of David's activities:

- **5am to 7am:** At the library (as seen by Sarah)
- **7am to 10am:** Fixing the computer (as seen by John)
- **10am to 12pm:** Buying a bike (as seen by Tiffany)
- **7pm to 10pm:** Buying a phone (as seen by William)

From this, it seems that David was quite busy from 5am until 12pm, except for the times when he was at the library, fixing the computer, buying a bike, and later buying a phone.

But wait, there's a gap between 12pm and 7pm. That might be when David was free to go to the market.

Also, the market is closed after 10pm, so David couldn't have gone to the market after 10pm.

So, the possible times for David to go to the market would be:

- **12pm to 7pm**
- **7pm to 10pm**

But let's double-check.

From the timeline:

- **5am to 7am:** At the library
- **7am to 10am:** Fixing the computer
- **10am to 12pm:** Buying a bike
- **7pm to 10pm:** Buying a phone

So, between 12pm and 7pm, David wasn't doing any of those activities mentioned by Sarah, John, Tiffany, or William.

Also, the market was closed after 10pm, so David couldn't have gone after 10pm.

Therefore, the times when David could have gone to the market are:

- **12pm to 7pm**
- **7pm to 10pm**

Looking at the options provided:

(A) 12pm to 7pm  
(B) 7pm to 10pm  
(C) 7am to 10am  
(D) 10am to 12pm

So, the correct answers would be options (A) and (B).

But the question says "Between what times could they have gone?" and the options are individual time frames. It seems like the answer should include both (A) and (B), but the options are given as single choices.

Wait, maybe I need to pick all that apply. But the options are labeled as (A), (B), (C), (D), suggesting only one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps the market was closed after 10pm, so David couldn't have gone after 10pm. So, the latest he could have gone is 10pm.

But in the options, (A) is 12pm to 7pm, and (B) is 7pm to 10pm.

So, both (A) and (B) are possible times when the market was open and David wasn't doing anything else.

But the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps the answer is both (A) and (B), but since the instructions say to pick one, maybe the intended answer is (A) 12pm to 7pm, considering that's when he was definitely free.

Alternatively, the question might be asking for the latest possible time, which would be (B) 7pm to 10pm.

But I think the correct approach is to consider that the market was closed after 10pm, so David couldn't have gone after that. So, he could have gone between 12pm to 7pm and 7pm to 10pm.

But since the options are given as (A), (B), (C), (D), and we need to pick one, I think the answer is (A) 12pm to 7pm and (B) 7pm to 10pm.

But the way the question is phrased, "Between what times could they have gone?" and the options are individual time frames, it might mean that both (A) and (B) are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is (A) and (B). However, in the format requested, it's to pick one letter.

Given that, I think the intended answer is (A) 12pm to 7pm, as that's when he was definitely free before the market closed.

But to be precise, since the market was closed after 10pm, David could have gone both between 12pm to 7pm and 7pm to 10pm.

But the options are separate, so probably both (A) and (B) are correct.

But the instructions say to put the final answer as one letter.

Hmm, maybe the answer is (A) and (B), but in the format, we can only pick one. So perhaps the correct answer is (A) and (B), but since the options are separate, I'll have to pick both.

But since the options are labeled as (A), (B), etc., and the user wants the final answer in one letter, maybe the answer is (A) 12pm to 7pm.

Wait, but the market was closed after 10pm, so David could have gone to the market at any time when he was free, which is from 12pm to 7pm and from 7pm to 10pm.

So, the possible times are (A) and (B).

But since the options are given as separate, and we need to choose one, perhaps the answer is both (A) and (B). However, the system may require a single answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the market was open until 10pm, so David could have gone both between 12pm to 7pm and 7pm to 10pm.

Therefore, the correct answer is both (A) and (B).

But since the options are separate, and the user wants the final answer as one letter, perhaps the answer is (A) and (B), but in the format, we can only pick one.

Given that, I think the intended answer is (A) 12pm to 7pm.
