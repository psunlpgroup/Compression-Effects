Okay, let me try to work through this logic problem step by step. So, the premise is a series of statements, and we need to determine whether the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain. 

First, let's list out all the premises to make it clearer:

1. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
2. Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.
3. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
4. All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
5. All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
6. If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
7. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

The conclusion is: Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players.

Alright, so let's break this down. The conclusion is about Coco Gauff's activity in major tennis. The first premise tells us that being ranked highly by WTA implies being one of the most active. So, if we can show that Coco Gauff is ranked highly, then the conclusion would follow.

Looking at premise 6: If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then he's not a male player. Since premise 5 says all male players lost to Rafael Nadal, and premise 4 says players are either male or female, then any male player lost to Rafael Nadal. Therefore, if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, he's a male player, which would contradict premise 6 unless he's not a male. Wait, no: premise 6 says if he's ranked highly OR lost to Nadal, then he's not a male. So, if he lost to Nadal, then he must not be a male, which is a contradiction because he's a player, and players are either male or female. So, let's think carefully.

Wait, premise 5: All male players lost to Rafael Nadal. So, any male player at Roland Garros lost to Nadal. So, if Coco Gauff is a male player, he must have lost to Nadal. But premise 6 says that if he either is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, then he's not a male. So, if he lost to Nadal, he's not a male, which can't be true because if he's a male, he must have lost to Nadal. This creates a contradiction, so the only way for this to be consistent is if Coco Gauff is not a male, meaning he's female. Therefore, he's a female player, so he didn't lose to Nadal because premise 3 says all female players lost to Świątek, not necessarily to Nadal. Wait, but premise 3 says all female players lost to Świątek. So, if Coco Gauff is female, he lost to Świątek, not necessarily to Nadal.

Wait, but premise 5 says all male players lost to Nadal. So, if Coco Gauff is female, he didn't lose to Nadal, but he did lose to Świątek. Now, premise 2 says everyone who lost to Świątek is ranked highly by WTA. So, since Coco Gauff lost to Świątek, he is ranked highly by WTA. Therefore, by premise 1, he is one of the most active players in major tennis. Therefore, the conclusion is true.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (premise 7). He either is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Nadal. Since he's a female player (because if he were male, he would have lost to Nadal, but that would contradict premise 6 unless he's not male), so he's female, thus he lost to Świątek (premise 3), and since everyone who lost to Świątek is ranked highly (premise 2), he is ranked highly, making him one of the most active (premise 1). Therefore, the conclusion holds.

Alternatively, another way: since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (premise 7), and he is either a male or female. If he's male, he must have lost to Nadal (premise 5). But premise 6 says that if he lost to Nadal, he's not male, which is a contradiction. Therefore, he must be female. As a female, she lost to Świątek (premise 3), so she is ranked highly (premise 2), hence active (premise 1). Therefore, conclusion is true.

Yes, that seems solid. So, the conclusion is true.
</think>

The conclusion is true because Coco Gauff, being a female player, lost to Iga Świątek, making her ranked highly by the WTA, thereby qualifying her as one of the most active Grand-Slam players.

**Answer:** The conclusion is true.
