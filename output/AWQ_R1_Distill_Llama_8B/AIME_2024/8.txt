Alright, so I have this problem here that says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of (y^x) equals 10, and log base y of (x^{4y}) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to make sense of this. Both logarithms are equal to 10. So, if I can write these equations out using logarithm properties, maybe I can find a relationship between x and y.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that here, this equation becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Using the same property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So, now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, maybe I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other or relate them somehow.

I also remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as something, say, t. Then, log_x(y) would be 1/t.

So, substituting into the first equation:

x * (1/t) = 10, so x/t = 10 => x = 10t.

Similarly, the second equation is 4y * t = 10, because log_y(x) is t.

So, now I have x = 10t and 4y * t = 10.

I can express y from the second equation: y = 10 / (4t) = (5)/(2t).

So, now I have expressions for x and y in terms of t.

So, x = 10t and y = 5/(2t).

Since x and y are both greater than 1, let's see what that tells us about t.

First, x = 10t > 1 => t > 1/10.

Second, y = 5/(2t) > 1 => 5/(2t) > 1 => 5 > 2t => t < 5/2.

So, t is between 1/10 and 5/2.

But, we need to find xy. So, let's compute xy in terms of t.

x = 10t, y = 5/(2t). So, xy = (10t)*(5/(2t)) = (10*5)/(2) * (t / t) = 50/2 * 1 = 25.

Wait, that's interesting. The t cancels out, so xy is 25 regardless of t? That seems too straightforward.

But let me double-check. So, xy = (10t)*(5/(2t)) = (10*5)/(2) * (t/t) = 50/2 * 1 = 25.

Yeah, t cancels out, so xy is indeed 25.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.

We started with log_x(y^x) = 10, which simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10, so log_x(y) = 10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 simplifies to 4y * log_y(x) = 10, so log_y(x) = 10/(4y).

But since log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x), we have:

(10/x) = 1 / (10/(4y)) => 10/x = 4y/10 => 10/x = (2y)/5.

So, cross-multiplying, 50 = 2xy.

Therefore, 2xy = 50 => xy = 25.

Yes, that's another way to see it. So, the product xy is 25.

So, regardless of the value of t, as long as x and y satisfy the given logarithmic conditions, their product will be 25.

Therefore, the answer should be 25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the product \(xy\) where both \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers greater than 1, and the following conditions hold:
\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the logarithm property \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\) to rewrite the given equations:
1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) simplifies to \(x \log_x(y) = 10\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) simplifies to \(4y \log_y(x) = 10\).

Next, we express the logarithms in terms of each other. We know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\). Let \(t = \log_y(x)\). Then, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{t}\).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \(x \cdot \frac{1}{t} = 10\) implies \(x = 10t\).
2. \(4y \cdot t = 10\) implies \(y = \frac{10}{4t} = \frac{5}{2t}\).

Now, we compute the product \(xy\):
\[
xy = (10t) \left(\frac{5}{2t}\right) = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
