Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Sarah could have gone to the art studio. So, here's what we know from the timeline:

1. **Sarah wakes up at 9am.**
   
   That's her starting point. So, her activities begin at 9am.

2. **Richard saw Sarah buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 12pm.**
   
   Okay, so from 9am to 12pm, Sarah is at the bike shop. That means she's not at the art studio during this time.

3. **Betty saw Sarah waiting at the train station from 12pm to 1pm.**
   
   After buying the bike, Sarah goes to the train station and waits there from 12pm to 1pm. So, she's not at the art studio during this period either.

4. **Michael saw Sarah buying clothes at the mall from 1pm to 3pm.**
   
   Next, Sarah is at the mall buying clothes from 1pm to 3pm. So, she's occupied there, not at the art studio.

5. **Jennifer saw Sarah working out at the gym from 3pm to 6pm.**
   
   After the mall, Sarah goes to the gym to work out. She's there from 3pm to 6pm. So, no time at the art studio during this period.

6. **Hannah saw Sarah buying a phone at the electronics store from 6pm to 8pm.**
   
   At 6pm, Sarah is at the electronics store buying a phone. She stays there until 8pm. So, again, no time at the art studio.

7. **The art studio was closed after 10pm.**
   
   This is important because it tells us the latest time Sarah could have gone to the art studio.

Now, let's piece this together:

- Sarah starts her day at 9am.
- From 9am to 12pm: Bike shop.
- 12pm to 1pm: Train station.
- 1pm to 3pm: Mall.
- 3pm to 6pm: Gym.
- 6pm to 8pm: Electronics store.
  
So, when is she free? After 8pm. But the art studio is closed after 10pm. So, she must have gone after 8pm but before 10pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 9am to 12pm: She's at the bike shop, so no.

(B) 3pm to 6pm: She's at the gym, so no.

(C) 12pm to 1pm: She's at the train station, so no.

(D) 8pm to 10pm: This fits because she's free after 8pm and the art studio is open until 10pm.

So, the correct time Sarah could have gone to the art studio is between 8pm and 10pm.
</think>

The correct answer is (D) 8pm to 10pm. 

**Answer:** (D)
