Okay, let's try to figure out when Samantha could have gone to the coffee shop. So, the timeline is as follows:

- Samantha wakes up at 6am.
- Richard sees her watching a movie at the theater from 6am to 10am.
- Mark sees her driving to the water park from 10am to 11am.
- John sees her stretching at a yoga studio from 11am to 6pm.
- The coffee shop was closed after 8pm.

First, I need to see when Samantha is free to go to the coffee shop. She's occupied from 6am to 6pm, but she might have short breaks in between when she's not doing any of those activities.

From Richard's sighting, she's at the theater from 6am to 10am. So, before that, she was at home, but she wakes up at 6am, so maybe she was at home before 6am. Wait, no, she wakes up at 6am, so that's when she starts her day.

Then, Richard sees her at the theater until 10am. So, from 6am to 10am, she's watching a movie. Then Mark sees her driving to the water park from 10am to 11am. So, she leaves the theater at 10am to go to the water park.

John sees her at the yoga studio from 11am to 6pm. So, she arrives at the yoga studio at 11am and stays there until 6pm.

Now, the coffee shop is closed after 8pm, so she can't go there after 8pm.

So, let's see when she's free:

- She wakes up at 6am, then goes to the theater until 10am.
- Then she goes to the water park from 10am to 11am.
- Then she goes to yoga from 11am to 6pm.

So, the times when she's not doing these activities are:

- From 6am to 6pm, but she's occupied from 6am to 6pm, so she doesn't have free time during that period.

Wait, that can't be right. She's moving from one place to another, so maybe she has short breaks in between.

Let me list her activities:

1. Wakes up at 6am.
2. Watches a movie at the theater from 6am to 10am.
3. Drives to the water park from 10am to 11am.
4. Stretches at a yoga studio from 11am to 6pm.

So, she's busy from 6am to 6pm, but the coffee shop is only open until 8pm. So, she could have gone to the coffee shop during her free time, which would be between 10am to 11am or 11am to 6pm, but the coffee shop is only open until 8pm.

Wait, the coffee shop was closed after 8pm, so she can't go after 8pm. So, she could have gone from 10am to 11am or from 11am to 8pm.

But looking at the options, the options are:

(A) 11am to 6pm

(B) 10am to 11am

(C) 6am to 10am

(D) 6pm to 8pm

So, she could have gone during 10am to 11am or 11am to 8pm. But 11am to 6pm is longer than the coffee shop's operating hours, which are up to 8pm. So, the correct time would be from 11am to 8pm, but since the options don't have that, the closest is (A) 11am to 6pm, but that includes times after 8pm when the coffee shop is closed. So, perhaps the correct answer is (A), assuming she went from 11am to 8pm, which is part of (A).

Alternatively, maybe she went from 10am to 11am, which is option (B).

Wait, but she was driving to the water park from 10am to 11am, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during that time. So, she could have gone from 11am to 8pm, which is part of (A). So, the answer is (A).

But wait, the coffee shop was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone after 8pm. So, she could have gone from 11am to 8pm, but that's not one of the options. The options are:

(A) 11am to 6pm

(B) 10am to 11am

(C) 6am to 10am

(D) 6pm to 8pm

So, the only possible time is 11am to 8pm, which is part of (A). So, the answer is (A).

But wait, the coffee shop is closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone after 8pm. So, she could have gone from 11am to 8pm, which is part of (A). So, the answer is (A).

Alternatively, maybe the answer is (B) 10am to 11am, but she was driving to the water park then, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop then.

Wait, maybe she left the theater at 10am, then went to the water park until 11am, so she was driving from 10am to 11am, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop then.

Then, she went to yoga from 11am to 6pm, but the coffee shop is only open until 8pm, so she could have gone from 11am to 8pm, which is part of (A). So, the answer is (A).

But the options don't specify the exact time, so (A) is the best fit.

The correct answer is (A) 11am to 6pm.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Samantha's schedule:**
   - Wakes up at 6am.
   - Watches a movie from 6am to 10am.
   - Drives to the water park from 10am to 11am.
   - Stretches at a yoga studio from 11am to 6pm.

2. **Determine the coffee shop's operating hours:**
   - The coffee shop is closed after 8pm.

3. **Find the free time Samantha had:**
   - She was occupied from 6am to 6pm, but she has a break from 11am to 6pm.
   - The coffee shop closes at 8pm, so she could have gone between 11am and 8pm.

4. **Check the options:**
   - Option (A) 11am to 6pm includes the time when the coffee shop was open (up to 8pm).

**Answer:** (A) 11am to 6pm
