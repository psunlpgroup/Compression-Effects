To determine how many members of the Scottish Government are part of the organization that enacted the Directory of Public Worship into law, I first need to identify the organization in question. The Directory of Public Worship was likely enacted by a governmental or regulatory body in Scotland. Assuming this is the Scottish Government itself, I would then look into the composition of its membership.

However, without specific details about the organization and its membership structure, it's challenging to provide an exact number. The Scottish Government typically comprises the First Minister, the Scottish Secretary, and other members who are elected or appointed. If the organization refers to the Scottish Government, the number of members can vary depending on the context or role.

Since the question is somewhat vague, I cannot provide an accurate answer. More information about the organization and its membership structure would be needed to determine the exact number of its members who are part of the Scottish Government.
