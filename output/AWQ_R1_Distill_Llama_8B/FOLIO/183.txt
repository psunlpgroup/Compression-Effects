Okay, so I need to figure out whether the conclusion is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me start by breaking down each premise and see how they relate to each other and to the conclusion.

First, the premises:

1. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
2. Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
3. All animal lovers are nice to animals.
4. All pet owners love animals.
5. Tom is a pet owner.

And the conclusion is: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.

Alright, let's go through each premise step by step.

Premise 1: No one nice to animals is also mean to animals. So, being nice to animals and being mean to animals are mutually exclusive. If someone is nice to animals, they can't be mean to animals, and vice versa.

Premise 2: Some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, there exists at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals.

Premise 3: All animal lovers are nice to animals. So, if someone is an animal lover, they are nice to animals.

Premise 4: All pet owners love animals. So, if someone is a pet owner, they love animals.

Premise 5: Tom is a pet owner.

Now, the conclusion is an implication: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The conclusion is saying that if Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals, then he's neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

But let's think about Tom's attributes based on the premises.

Since Tom is a pet owner (Premise 5), from Premise 4, all pet owners love animals, so Tom is an animal lover.

So, Tom is an animal lover (from Premise 4 and 5). From Premise 3, all animal lovers are nice to animals. So, Tom is nice to animals.

Now, from Premise 1, no one nice to animals is also mean to animals. Since Tom is nice to animals, he cannot be mean to animals.

So, Tom is not mean to animals. Therefore, the condition in the conclusion, "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals," is actually automatically true because Tom is not mean to animals, regardless of whether he's grumpy or not.

But the conclusion is a conditional statement: If [Tom is not both grumpy and mean], then Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

Wait, but we know Tom is an animal lover (from Premise 4 and 5), so if the conclusion says Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover, that would mean Tom is not an animal lover, which contradicts our earlier deduction that Tom is an animal lover.

Hmm, that seems problematic. Let me check my reasoning again.

Premise 4: All pet owners love animals. Tom is a pet owner, so Tom loves animals.

Premise 3: All animal lovers are nice to animals. Therefore, Tom is nice to animals.

Premise 1: No one nice to animals is also mean to animals. So, Tom is nice to animals and not mean to animals.

Premise 2: Some grumpy people are mean to animals. So, there are grumpy people who are mean, but it doesn't say anything about all grumpy people.

Now, the conclusion is: If Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

But we know Tom is an animal lover, so the conclusion would be implying that Tom is not an animal lover, which is a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the conclusion is trying to say that if Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then he must not be grumpy or not be an animal lover. But since we know Tom is an animal lover, the conclusion would be false because it's claiming he's not an animal lover.

But wait, let's approach it differently. The conclusion is an implication: If [not (grumpy and mean)], then [not grumpy and not animal lover].

But we know that Tom is an animal lover, so the conclusion is trying to say that Tom is not an animal lover, which is false. Therefore, the implication is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is trying to say that if Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then he is not grumpy and not an animal lover. But since Tom is an animal lover, the conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, but the conclusion is a conditional statement, so it's not necessarily claiming that Tom is not an animal lover; it's saying that if he's not both grumpy and mean, then he's neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

But since Tom is an animal lover, the conclusion is implying that he is not an animal lover, which is a contradiction, making the conclusion false.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is a tautology or a logical fallacy.

Wait, let me think in terms of logical statements.

Let me define:

Let G represent grumpy.

Let M represent mean to animals.

Let A represent animal lover.

Let P represent pet owner.

From Premise 4: All P are A. So, P → A.

Tom is P (Premise 5), so Tom → A.

From Premise 3: All A are nice to animals (since Premise 3 says all animal lovers are nice). So, A → ¬M (since no nice is mean).

Therefore, Tom → ¬M.

So, Tom is not mean to animals.

Now, Premise 2: Some G are M. So, there exists x such that G(x) ∧ M(x).

The conclusion is: If ¬(G ∧ M), then ¬G ∧ ¬A.

But Tom is not M (since Tom → ¬M), so for Tom, ¬(G ∧ M) is true regardless of G.

Therefore, the antecedent of the conclusion is true for Tom.

So, the conclusion is saying that if ¬(G ∧ M) is true, then ¬G ∧ ¬A is true.

But since Tom is an animal lover (Tom → A), ¬A is false for Tom. Therefore, the conclusion is claiming that ¬G ∧ ¬A is true for Tom, which is false because ¬A is false.

Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Wait, but let me make sure.

The conclusion is: If Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover.

But we know that Tom is an animal lover, so the conclusion is saying Tom is not an animal lover, which is false. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is trying to say that if Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then he is not grumpy, and he is not an animal lover. But since he is an animal lover, the second part is false, making the entire implication false.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
</think>

The conclusion is false because it incorrectly asserts that Tom is not an animal lover, whereas we know from the premises that Tom, as a pet owner, is indeed an animal lover. Therefore, the implication does not hold.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
