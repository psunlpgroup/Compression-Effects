Okay, so I need to figure out if James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university based on the given premises. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, the premise says that none of the students currently working in the library are from the computer science department. So, if someone is working in the library, they aren't in CS. 

Next, it mentions that all students with part-time jobs offered by the university are currently working in the library. That means if a student has a part-time job, they must be working in the library. So, having a part-time job implies working in the library.

Then, it states that all students taking the database course are from the computer science department. So, if someone is in the database course, they're in CS.

All students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. So, if someone is in Professor David's class, they're in the database course, which means they're in CS.

Also, all students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David. So, working in the lab means taking his class, which means they're in the database course and hence in CS.

James is a student working in the lab. So, James is in the lab, which means he's taking Professor David's class, which means he's in the database course, so he's from the CS department.

Now, the conclusion is that James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university. Let me see if that's necessarily true.

From the premises, all part-time jobs are held by students working in the library. Since James is working in the lab, not the library, he isn't one of those students with part-time jobs. Therefore, James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university. So the conclusion seems to follow logically.

The conclusion that James does not have a part-time job offered by the university is true based on the premises. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - All part-time jobs are held by students working in the library (Premise 2).
   - James works in the lab, not the library (Premise 6).
   - Therefore, James cannot be among the students with part-time jobs.

2. **Logical Deduction:**
   - Since James is not in the library, he does not hold a part-time job offered by the university.

**Conclusion:** James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.
