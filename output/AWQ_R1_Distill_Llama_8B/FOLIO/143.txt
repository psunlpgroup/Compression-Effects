Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the conclusion that Aurochs are extinct is true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the premise states that breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate breeding of domestic animals. So, breeding back means selecting and breeding animals to resemble extinct ones, right? The example given is Heck cattle, which were bred back in the 1920s to resemble aurochs. Heck cattle are animals, and aurochs are also animals, as stated in the premises.

So, the key points here are that Heck cattle are a type of domestic animal, and through breeding, they are made to look like aurochs, which are a different type of animal. Now, the question is whether this process of breeding back implies that aurochs are extinct.

I know that aurochs are large, extinct animals, related to modern-day domestic cattle. The Heck cattle were developed to resemble aurochs, which suggests that the auroch was already extinct when Heck cattle were being bred to look like them. If aurochs were still around, you couldn't have bred animals to resemble them because they'd be alive. So, the fact that Heck cattle were bred to resemble aurochs implies that aurochs are indeed extinct because you can't breed live animals to look like another live species.

But wait, is there a possibility that aurochs are still alive? I don't think so. From what I remember, aurochs are considered extinct, meaning they no longer exist in the wild or have been domesticated into what we have as cows today. So, if aurochs were alive, you couldn't have used them as a model for breeding Heck cattle because you'd have to work with live aurochs, which aren't available anymore.

Another angle: the premise says that some animals are bred back to resemble extinct animals. Since aurochs are extinct, it's logical that Heck cattle were bred to look like them because the actual aurochs aren't around anymore. If aurochs were still present, you wouldn't need to breed animals to resemble them; you'd just use them as a template.

I'm trying to think if there's any scenario where aurochs aren't extinct and yet Heck cattle were bred to look like them. Maybe in a fictional context or something, but based on the premise given, we're dealing with real animals here. So, it's safe to assume aurochs are extinct.

Therefore, the conclusion that Aurochs are extinct seems to follow logically from the premises provided. The process of breeding back implies that the target of the breeding (aurochs) is no longer present, hence they are extinct.

The conclusion that Aurochs are extinct is **true** based on the premises. The process of breeding Heck cattle to resemble aurochs, an extinct species, logically implies that aurochs no longer exist.
