Alright, let's try to figure out when Hannah could have gone to the art studio. I'll take it step by step.

First, let's list out all the information we have:

1. **Hannah's Wake-Up Time**: She woke up at 6 am.
2. **Thomas's Observation**: He saw Hannah at the library from 6 am to 8 am.
3. **David's Observation**: He saw her getting coffee from 8 am to 10 am.
4. **Leslie's Observation**: She saw Hannah stretching at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm.
5. **Ashley's Observation**: She saw Hannah walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 7 pm to 8 pm.
6. **Studio Hours**: The art studio was closed after 8 pm.

So, Hannah's activities are observed at different times by different people. We need to find the window when she could have been at the art studio.

Let's break it down:

- **Morning Observations**:
  - From 6 am to 8 am, Thomas saw her at the library.
  - From 8 am to 10 am, David saw her getting coffee.
  
  This means Hannah was at the library from 6 to 8 am and then got coffee from 8 to 10 am.

- **Evening Observations**:
  - Leslie saw her stretching at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm.
  - Ashley saw her walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 7 pm to 8 pm.

  So, Hannah was at the yoga studio from 6 to 7 pm and then was en route to the Statue of Liberty from 7 to 8 pm.

Now, the question is: When could Hannah have gone to the art studio?

Given that the art studio was closed after 8 pm, Hannah must have visited it before 8 pm.

Looking at the morning observations, she was occupied from 6 am to 10 am (library and coffee). So, she didn't have time to go to the art studio in the morning.

In the evening, she was at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm and then moving towards the Statue of Liberty from 7 pm to 8 pm. So, she didn't have time to go to the art studio in the evening either.

Wait, but the options provided include 10 am to 6 pm and 7 pm to 8 pm. From the timeline, she was at the library until 8 am, got coffee until 10 am, and then was at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm, and moving from 7 pm to 8 pm.

So, she didn't have any free time between 10 am and 6 pm or between 7 pm and 8 pm.

Hmm, but the options are:

(A) 10am to 6pm

(B) 7pm to 8pm

(C) 6am to 8am

(D) 8am to 10am

Wait, the only time she was free would be between 10 am and 6 pm? But according to the observations, she was at the library from 6 to 8 am and coffee from 8 to 10 am. So, she didn't have time to go to the studio in the morning.

In the evening, she was at the yoga studio from 6 to 7 pm and then moving from 7 to 8 pm, so no time for the art studio.

But the options don't include any other time. Maybe the correct answer is (A) 10am to 6pm, even though she was occupied during that time.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The art studio was closed after 8 pm, so she could have gone before 8 pm.

But in the morning, she was occupied until 10 am, and in the evening, from 6 pm to 8 pm. So, the only time she wasn't observed is between 10 am to 6 pm.

Wait, but she was at the library from 6 to 8 am and coffee from 8 to 10 am. So, from 10 am onward, she was free until 6 pm, when Leslie saw her at the yoga studio.

So, perhaps between 10 am to 6 pm, she could have gone to the art studio.

But the art studio was closed after 8 pm, so she must have gone before 8 pm.

Wait, maybe she went in the evening before 6 pm.

But Leslie saw her at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm, so she was there then.

So, she couldn't have gone to the art studio after 6 pm because she was at the yoga studio.

Therefore, the only possible time is between 10 am to 6 pm, but considering the art studio was closed after 8 pm, she must have gone before 8 pm.

So, the time between 10 am to 6 pm is when she could have gone, but considering she was busy until 10 am, she must have gone from 10 am to 6 pm.

Wait, but that's not possible because she was at the library until 8 am and coffee until 10 am.

So, the only possible time is between 10 am to 6 pm, but she was occupied until 10 am.

Wait, maybe the answer is (A) 10am to 6pm.

But I'm confused because she was observed at the library until 8 am and coffee until 10 am, so she didn't have time to go to the studio in the morning.

In the evening, she was at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm, so she couldn't have gone to the art studio then.

So, the only time she wasn't observed is between 10 am to 6 pm, but considering she was occupied until 10 am, she didn't have time to go.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is (A) 10am to 6pm.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is (A).

So, the answer is (A).

But wait, the art studio was closed after 8 pm, so she must have gone before 8 pm.

She was at the yoga studio from 6 pm to 7 pm, so she couldn't have gone to the art studio then.

She was at the library from 6 am to 8 am and coffee from 8 am to 10 am, so she didn't have time to go to the studio in the morning.

Therefore, she couldn't have gone to the art studio at all.

Wait, but the question says "Between what times could they have gone?" implying that it's possible.

So, maybe the answer is (A) 10am to 6pm.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is (A).

I think the correct answer is (A) 10am to 6pm.

The correct answer is (A) 10am to 6pm.
