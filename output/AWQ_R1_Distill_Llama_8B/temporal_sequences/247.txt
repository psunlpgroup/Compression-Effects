Okay, let's try to figure out when Nancy could have gone to the movies. I'll go through the information step by step.

First, Nancy woke up at 8am. So her day starts at 8am.

Next, Richard saw Nancy fixing their computer at the electronic store from 8am to 12pm. That means from 8am to noon, she was at the store.

Then, Mark saw Nancy stretching at a yoga studio from 12pm to 2pm. So from noon to 2pm, she was at the yoga studio.

After that, Nancy saw herself working out at the gym from 2pm to 5pm. So from 2pm to 5pm, she was at the gym.

William saw Nancy getting a coffee at the cafe from 5pm to 6pm. So from 5pm to 6pm, she was at the cafe.

Steven saw Nancy walking in the garden from 7pm to 9pm. So from 7pm to 9pm, she was in the garden.

The movies was closed after 9pm, which means the movies operating hours ended at 9pm.

Now, let's see when Nancy wasn't occupied. She was at the store from 8am to 12pm, yoga from 12pm to 2pm, gym from 2pm to 5pm, cafe from 5pm to 6pm, and garden from 7pm to 9pm.

So, the times when she wasn't doing those activities are:

- Between 6pm to 7pm: She was free because she was at the cafe until 6pm and then at the garden from 7pm onwards.

- Also, between 9pm and when? The movies closed after 9pm, but she was at the garden until 9pm. So she didn't have time to go to the movies after 9pm because the movies were closed.

So the only possible time she could have gone to the movies is between 6pm to 7pm.

Looking at the options:

(A) 6pm to 7pm  
(B) 2pm to 5pm  
(C) 5pm to 6pm  
(D) 7pm to 9pm

The correct time is when she was free, which is 6pm to 7pm, so option A.
