The draft, as mentioned, began in 1940. This aligns with the historical context of the war depicted in *The Things They Carried*, which takes place during the Vietnam War. However, the Vietnam War occurred in the mid- to late 1960s, suggesting a potential inconsistency. It's possible that the question refers to a different historical context or an fictional element within the narrative. For the purpose of this answer, the draft started in 1940.
