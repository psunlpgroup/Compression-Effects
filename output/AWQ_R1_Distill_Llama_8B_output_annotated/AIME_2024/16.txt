["initializing"] Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. ["end-section"] ["initializing"] Then, I need to compute r squared and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and finally find p + q. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] We have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a fixed surface area of 54 and a fixed volume of 23. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] For each such box, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The radius of this sphere will be the same for all boxes in the set because they all have the same surface area and volume. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, our goal is to find the minimal radius r such that any box in set B can fit inside a sphere of radius r. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, let's recall some properties of a rectangular box. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height, which we can denote as x, y, and z respectively. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume (V) is xyz = 23. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We also know that for a box to fit inside a sphere, the space diagonal of the box must be less than or equal to the diameter of the sphere. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] The space diagonal d of a box with dimensions x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Since the sphere's diameter is 2r, we have the inequality sqrt(x² + y² + z²) ≤ 2r. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Therefore, r must be at least half the space diagonal of the box. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] To find the smallest possible r that works for all boxes in B, we need to maximize the space diagonal over all possible boxes in B. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, r is equal to half the maximum possible space diagonal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, our task reduces to finding the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, let's formalize this: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] We need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) subject to: 1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 2. xyz = 23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] To make it easier, perhaps we can work with the squared terms since sqrt is a monotonic function. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] So, we can maximize x² + y² + z². ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Let me denote S = x² + y² + z² and P = xyz = 23, and Q = xy + yz + xz = 27 (since 2Q = 54). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we have: Q = 27, P = 23, S = ? ["end-section"] ["deduction"] We need to maximize S. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Now, I remember that for three variables, there's a relation involving S, Q, and P. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Specifically, for positive real numbers x, y, z, we have the identity: ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz) = S + 2Q ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But I don't know if that helps directly. ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Alternatively, I recall that for variables constrained by their sum and products, we can use Lagrange multipliers to find maxima. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, let's try using Lagrange multipliers. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We need to maximize S = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints: 1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 (which simplifies to xy + yz + xz = 27) 2. xyz = 23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, set up the Lagrangian function: L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23) ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] Take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ, and set them equal to zero. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Compute ∂L/∂x: 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Similarly, ∂L/∂y: 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] And ∂L/∂z: 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Also, the constraints: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] xy + yz + xz = 27 ["end-section"] ["deduction"] xyz = 23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, now we have a system of equations: 1. 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0 2. 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0 3. 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0 4. xy + yz + xz = 27 5. xyz = 23 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can assume symmetry or particular relations between x, y, z. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that two variables are equal. Let me see. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Suppose that x = y. Then, let's see if that leads us somewhere. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let x = y, then: From the surface area constraint: x² + xz + zx = 27 => x² + 2xz = 27 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] From the volume constraint: x² z = 23 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, let me denote x = y, so: Equation 1: x² + 2xz = 27 Equation 2: x² z = 23 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] We can solve these equations for x and z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From Equation 2: z = 23 / (x²) Substitute into Equation 1: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] x² + 2x*(23 / (x²)) = 27 Simplify: x² + (46 / x) = 27 Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator: x³ + 46 = 27x ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Bring all terms to one side: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, we have a cubic equation in x: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Testing x=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0 ["end-section"]
["example-testing"] x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 → Hey, x=2 is a root! ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x - 23) = 0 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Thus, the roots are x=2, and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ± 2√6 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Since x is a length, it must be positive, so x=2 or x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, x=2 or x≈3.899 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let me compute z for x=2: From Equation 2: z = 23 / (2²) = 23 / 4 = 5.75 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S = x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Alternatively, for x ≈3.899, which is -1 + 2√6: Compute z = 23 / (x²) ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] But x ≈3.899, so x²≈15.21 Then z≈23 /15.21≈1.514 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S = x² + y² + z²≈15.21 +15.21 +2.295≈32.715 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, S is smaller in this case, so the maximum S is achieved when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving S≈41.0625 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But is this the maximum? ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, maybe not necessarily. ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] Because when we assumed x=y, perhaps the maximum occurs when all three variables are equal? Let me check. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Suppose x=y=z. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Then, from surface area: 3x² =27 → x²=9 →x=3 Volume: x³=27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, such a box with x=y=z=3 doesn't satisfy the volume constraint. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, the box cannot be a cube. So, the maximum S occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, we get S≈41.06, but when x=y≈3.899, z≈1.514, we get S≈32.715, which is less. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But is this the only case? Maybe not. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Perhaps there's a case where all three variables are different, giving a higher S. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, perhaps the maximum S is achieved when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Hmm. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, but since the volume is fixed, if one variable is larger, the others have to be smaller. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But how does that affect S? It might not be straightforward. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers more formally. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me denote the Lagrangian: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23) Then, taking partial derivatives: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] ∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0 ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] ∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Also, the constraints: xy + yz + xz =27 xyz=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we have five equations: 1. 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0 2. 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0 3. 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0 4. xy + yz + xz =27 5. xyz=23 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] This is a system of nonlinear equations which might be tricky, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but perhaps we can find a relation between x, y, z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2: [2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] - [2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz)] =0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Which simplifies to: 2x - 2y - λ(y + z - x - z) - μ(yz - xz) =0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Simplify: 2(x - y) - λ(y - x) - μ z(y - x) =0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor (x - y): [2 + λ + μ z] (x - y) =0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, if x ≠ y, then 2 + λ + μ z=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, subtract equation 1 and equation 3: 2x - 2z - λ(y + z - x - y) - μ(yz - xy)=0 Simplify: 2(x - z) - λ(z - x) - μ y(z - x)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor (x - z): [2 + λ + μ y] (x - z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Again, if x ≠ z, then 2 + λ + μ y=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, from the first subtraction, we have 2 + λ + μ z=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] And from the second subtraction, 2 + λ + μ y=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, setting them equal: 2 + λ + μ z = 2 + λ + μ y Which implies μ z = μ y ["end-section"]

["deduction"] If μ ≠0, then z=y ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, if we subtract equation 2 and equation 3, we can get another relation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But perhaps let's assume that y = z, similar to what we did earlier. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, but from the above, if μ ≠0, then z = y. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, perhaps two variables are equal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, let's assume y = z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, our constraints become: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] From surface area: xy + y² + xz =27 → x y + y² + x y =27 → 2x y + y²=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From volume: x y²=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, let me denote y = z. Then, we have: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Equation 1: 2x y + y² =27 Equation 2: x y² = 23 We can solve for x from Equation 2: x=23/(y²) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Substitute into Equation 1: 2*(23/y²)*y + y²=27 Simplify: 46/y + y²=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Multiply both sides by y: 46 + y³ =27 y ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Bring all terms to one side: y³ -27 y +46=0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, similar to the previous case, but with y instead of x. ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] Again, trying rational roots, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Testing y=1:1 -27 +46=20≠0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] y=2:8 -54 +46=0→ y=2 is a root. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] So, factor as (y -2)(y² +2y -23)=0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Thus, roots are y=2 and y=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4√6)/2= -1 ±2√6 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Again, y must be positive, so y=2 or y≈-1 +2√6≈3.899 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, for y=2: ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] From Equation 2: x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, x=5.75, y=2, z=2 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S=5.75² +2² +2²=33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] For y≈3.899: Compute x=23/(y²)=23/(15.21)≈1.514 So, x≈1.514, y≈3.899, z≈3.899 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S≈(1.514)^2 + (3.899)^2 + (3.899)^2≈2.295 +15.21 +15.21≈32.715 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Again, S is smaller in this case. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the maximum S is 41.0625, which is 41.0625= 41 + 1/16= 657/16 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, 41.0625 is 41 and 1/16, which is 41*16 +1=656 +1=657, so 657/16. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But we need to find the minimal sphere radius r such that sqrt(x² + y² + z²) ≤2r. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, r must be at least half of the space diagonal, so r= (sqrt(S))/2. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but actually, in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=41.0625, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so 2r≈3.218, but actually, the sphere must contain the box, so the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so the radius must be at least half of that. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, no, wait. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609. So, the diameter is about 3.218, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so the radius is about 1.609. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But we need to ensure that this is the minimal r such that all boxes in B can fit inside a sphere of radius r. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we need to make sure that for any box in B, its space diagonal is less than or equal to 2r. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But is the maximum space diagonal achieved when x=y=2, z=5.75? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, perhaps, but let me think. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when two variables are equal, but I need to confirm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, in the Lagrangian approach, when we subtracted the equations, we found that either variables are equal or certain relations hold. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But given that in both cases when we set two variables equal, we get S=657/16 and S≈32.715, so the former is larger. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But is there a case where all three variables are different and S is larger? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] I think not, because in order to maximize S, given fixed Q and P, the maximum S occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible, given the constraints. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but in our case, when we set two variables equal, we obtained a specific case where S is maximized. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Since we have found that case, perhaps that is indeed the maximum. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, ["end-section"] ["adding-knowledge"] perhaps I can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the root mean square. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] We know that for positive numbers a, b, c: sqrt((a² + b² + c²)/3) ≥ (a + b + c)/3 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But not sure if that helps here. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities to relate S, Q, and P. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] another approach: from the theory of symmetric functions, for variables with given sum of products and product, we can express S in terms of Q and P. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But I don't recall the exact formula. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for three variables, the following identity holds: x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But we don't know x + y + z. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality for x, y, z. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But I don't think that's directly helpful. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me denote a = x, b = y, c = z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Given that: ab + bc + ca =27 abc=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We can use the method of symmetric polynomials. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me denote s1 = a + b + c ["end-section"]

["deduction"] s2 = ab + bc + ca =27 s3 = abc=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We know that for three variables, we can relate s1, s2, s3 with the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the cubic equation is t³ - s1 t² + s2 t - s3=0, which is t³ - s1 t² +27 t -23=0 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But I don't know s1, so perhaps not helpful. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, we can use the inequality that relates s1, s2, s3. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps another idea. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We can fix s2 and s3, and then find the minimal or maximal s1² = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca) = S + 2*27= S +54 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, s1² = S +54. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But we also know that for positive numbers, s1³ ≥ 27 abc (AM ≥ GM) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, s1³ ≥27*23=621 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, s1 ≥ cube root of 621≈8.56 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But s1 is a + b + c, so it's just a number. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, maybe not helpful. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps another approach. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me fix two variables, say x and y, and express z in terms of x and y. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From the volume constraint: z=23/(xy) From the surface area constraint: 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 → xy + yz + xz=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Substitute z=23/(xy): xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Simplify: xy + 23/x +23/y=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we have: xy +23/x +23/y=27 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let me denote t = x y Then, the equation becomes: t +23/t +23/t=27 → Wait, no. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, hold on. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, no, 23/x +23/y is not 23/t. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, let me think. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, if t=xy, then 23/x +23/y=23(1/x +1/y)=23(y +x)/(xy)=23(x + y)/t ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the equation becomes: t +23(x + y)/t=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But x + y can be expressed as (x + y)= s - z, but we don't have s. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Hmm, this might not help. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps we can let u = x + y and v = xy Then, z=23/v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] And the surface area equation becomes: v +23/u=27 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, no, because 23/x +23/y=23(u)/v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the equation is v +23u/v=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Multiply both sides by v: v² +23u=27v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, v² -27v +23u=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But u and v are related by u² ≥4v (since (x + y)^2 ≥4xy) ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But this seems complicated. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, perhaps fix u= x + y and v=xy, and then we have: v² -27v +23u=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But we also have u² ≥4v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, perhaps we can express u in terms of v: u= (27v -v²)/23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, plug into u² ≥4v: [(27v -v²)/23]^2 ≥4v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] This would give a quadratic in v: (27v -v²)^2 /23² ≥4v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Multiply both sides by 23²: (27v -v²)^2 ≥4v*529 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Expand the left side: (27v -v²)^2 = (27v)^2 - 2*27v*v² + (v²)^2 =729v² -54v³ +v^4 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, we have: 729v² -54v³ +v^4 ≥4v*529=2116v ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Bring all terms to left: v^4 -54v³ +729v² -2116v ≥0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: v(v³ -54v² +729v -2116) ≥0 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Hmm, this seems messy. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier result where x=y=2, z=5.75 gives the maximum S=657/16. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4, so r= sqrt(657)/8. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, hold on, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] because the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, so the sphere radius must be half of that, which is sqrt(657)/8. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, no, wait: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(S). ["end-section"] ["deduction"] The sphere's diameter must be at least that, so radius is at least half of that. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, r= (sqrt(S))/2= sqrt(657)/8. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But wait, sqrt(657)/8 is approximately sqrt(625 +32)/8≈25.03/8≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius is half of that, which is≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, but in this case, r≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But earlier, I thought that the radius needed is sqrt(657)/8≈3.128, but that's not correct because the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609, so radius is half of that≈0.804, which is not correct. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, I'm getting confused. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.437/4≈1.609. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But that can't be, because if x=2, y=2, z=5.75, then space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, not 1.609. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, S =x² + y² + z²=657/16. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, no, 25.03/4≈6.257, but sqrt(657)=25.03, so sqrt(657)/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, no, 25.03/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but if S=657/16, then sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the space diagonal is≈6.257, so the sphere's diameter must be at least≈6.257, so radius≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] But when we computed for x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal was sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, which is larger than 6.257. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] So, which one is correct? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, then S=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But earlier, when we used Lagrange multipliers, we found a critical point where x=y=2, z=5.75, which gives S=41.0625. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But when we assumed y=z, we found that x=5.75, y=z=2, which is the same as above. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, perhaps that is indeed the maximum S. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But then, why in the earlier approach with Lagrangian multipliers, when we assumed x=y, we got a maximum S=41.0625. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, perhaps that is the maximum S, hence the maximum space diagonal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, r is half of that, so r= sqrt(41.0625)/2=6.437/2≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, but 41.0625=657/16. So, sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, so r= sqrt(657)/8≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Wait, but 6.437/2≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, confusion arises from the fact that sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, so radius is half of that≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] But when we compute space diagonal from x=y=2, z=5.75, we get sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius is half≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] So, which one is correct? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, when we have S=657/16, then sqrt(S)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But the space diagonal is sqrt(S)=sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] so the sphere's diameter is 2r≥sqrt(S), so r≥sqrt(S)/2≈6.257/2≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] But wait, in reality, for the specific box with x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so in that case, r must be at least≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] So, which one is larger? 3.218 is larger, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so that would be the minimal r required. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, so r≈3.128, but the specific box has space diagonal≈6.437, so r must be at least≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is≈6.437, so r≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But wait, is that the maximum possible space diagonal over all boxes in B? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Because if we can have a box with a larger space diagonal, then r would have to be larger. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But from our earlier exploration, when we set x=y=2, z=5.75, we get the space diagonal≈6.437, which is larger than when we set x=y≈3.899, z≈1.514, which had a smaller space diagonal. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] So, is this the maximum? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, perhaps. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Let me check if another configuration could give a larger space diagonal. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Suppose one variable is very large, and the other two are very small. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But due to the volume constraint, if one variable is very large, the other two must be very small such that their product with the large variable gives a fixed volume. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But how does that affect the space diagonal? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me suppose x approaches infinity, then y and z must approach zero such that xyz=23. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, suppose x approaches infinity, y approaches zero, z approaches zero, such that x*y*z=23. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But then, the surface area would be 2(xy + xz)=54 → x(y + z)=27. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But since x*y*z=23, and y,z are small, let me set y=z. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, y=z, then: x*(2y)=27 →x=27/(2y) And volume: x y²=23→ (27/(2y)) * y²=23→ (27 y)/2=23→ y= (46)/27≈1.7037 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Then, x=27/(2*1.7037)≈27/3.407≈7.94 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] So, x≈7.94, y=z≈1.7037 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S= x² + y² + z²≈63.04 +2.896 +2.896≈68.832 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, space diagonal≈sqrt(68.832)≈8.29 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Which is larger than the previous maximum of≈6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, so that's a problem because if this is the case, then the maximum space diagonal is≈8.29, which would mean that r≈4.145 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But how is that possible? Did I make a mistake? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, hold on, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] because if x approaches infinity, y and z approach zero, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but in our case, x, y, z are positive real numbers, so they can't actually approach infinity or zero, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but can become arbitrarily large or small. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But in our problem, we have fixed surface area and fixed volume, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so perhaps the space diagonal can be made arbitrarily large? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But no, since volume is fixed, if x increases, y and z must decrease. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But let's see, is there a maximum for the space diagonal? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, the problem is that when we fix volume and surface area, can the space diagonal be unbounded? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Or is there a maximum? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, actually, for fixed volume and surface area, is the space diagonal bounded? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Hmm, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] let me think. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] If we let x become very large, then y and z become very small, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but the surface area would require that x(y + z)≈27, as we saw earlier. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But then, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). ["end-section"]

["deduction"] If x is large, but y and z are small, does this necessarily make the space diagonal large? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["example-testing"] for example, if x is 100, then y and z would be approximately sqrt(23/(100))≈0.22 each, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but then x(y + z)=100*(0.22 +0.22)=44, which is less than 27? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, no, that's not. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, let's correct that. ["end-section"] ["deduction"] Wait, from surface area: x(y + z)=27/2≈13.5 If x=100, then y + z=13.5/100≈0.135 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But volume: x y z=23, so 100 y z=23→ y z=0.23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But y + z=0.135, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so we have: y + z=0.135 y z=0.23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But the discriminant of the quadratic equation t² -0.135 t +0.23=0 is (0.135)^2 -4*0.23≈0.0182 -0.92≈-0.9018 <0 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] So, no real solution, meaning that such y and z do not exist. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, x cannot be 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, perhaps there is a maximum x beyond which no real y and z exist. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, the space diagonal cannot be made arbitrarily large. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when y and z are equal, which is the case we computed earlier. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Wait, but when I tried y=z≈1.7037, x≈7.94, I got S≈68.832, so space diagonal≈8.29. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But is that the maximum? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, let's compute the space diagonal for that case: x≈7.94, y=z≈1.7037 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S≈7.94² +1.7037² +1.7037²≈63.04 +2.896 +2.896≈68.832 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, sqrt(68.832)≈8.29. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But let me check if that is indeed a maximum. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, when I set y=z, we get a specific case where two variables are equal, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] but is that the maximum? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Alternatively, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps the maximum is achieved when one variable is much larger than the others, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but we saw that when we tried to set x very large, we couldn't find real y and z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps the maximum is achieved when y=z, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which gives S≈68.832. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] But wait, in that case, S≈68.832=1089/16. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, 68.832*16≈1095.312, which is not exact. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, 68.832=68 + 0.832. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] 0.832*16≈13.312, so total≈68 +13.312≈81.312, ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] which is not helpful. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, perhaps exact value. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, in the case when y=z, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] we had: From surface area: 2x y + y²=27 From volume: x y²=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Set y=z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, equation 1: 2x y + y²=27 Equation 2: x y²=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Express x from equation 2: x=23/(y²) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Plug into equation 1: 2*(23/y²)*y + y²=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Simplify: 46/y + y²=27 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Multiply both sides by y: 46 + y³=27 y ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, y³ -27 y +46=0 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] As before, roots are y=2 and y=(-2 ±sqrt(4 + 92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 + 9.798)/2≈3.899 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, y=2 is a root, giving x=23/(2²)=5.75, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] space diagonal sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Another root is y≈3.899, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] giving x≈1.514, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] space diagonal≈sqrt(1.514² +3.899² +3.899²)=sqrt(2.295 +15.21 +15.21)=sqrt(32.715)=5.727 ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, hold on, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] when y=3.899, x≈1.514, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so x≈1.514, y=z≈3.899 ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Compute S= x² + y² + z²≈2.295 +15.21 +15.21≈32.715 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, sqrt(S)=sqrt(32.715)≈5.727 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But earlier, when y=1.7037, x≈7.94, space diagonal≈8.29 ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But wait, how does that align with our previous result? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, in the case when we assumed y=z, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] we had two roots, y=2 and y≈3.899, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] but in reality, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] when we assumed y=z, we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which gave us y=2 and y≈3.899, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but when we set y=1.7037, that wasn't a solution from that equation. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, I think I got confused. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, when we set y=z, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the case where y=1.7037, x≈7.94 is not under the assumption that y=z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, actually, that case is a different scenario where perhaps x is not equal to y=z. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, in that case, how did I get y=1.7037? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, earlier, I tried to fix x=100, but that didn't work because it led to an impossible equation for y and z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] perhaps I need to think differently. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, in order to find the maximum space diagonal, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] and the third is different, as in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But ["end-section"] ["deduction"] when I tried y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] I got a higher S=68.832, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which would imply a higher space diagonal≈8.29, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is larger than the previous case. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But in that case, how did that happen? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] perhaps because in that case, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] y and z are not equal to each other or to x. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but ["end-section"] ["deduction"] in that case, x is different from y and z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but if x, y, z are all different, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps that could give a higher S. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But how? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, maybe ["end-section"] ["deduction"] I can consider that the maximum of S occurs when one variable is as large as possible, given the constraints. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But how to formalize that. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Alternatively, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, earlier, we had: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] From the Lagrangian, we found that if x ≠ y ≠ z, then: From the partial derivatives, we had: 2x - λ(y + z) - μ y z=0 2y - λ(x + z) - μ x z=0 2z - λ(x + y) - μ x y=0 And the constraints: xy + yz + xz=27 xyz=23 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, let me denote equation 1: 2x = λ(y + z) + μ y z Equation 2: 2y = λ(x + z) + μ x z Equation 3: 2z = λ(x + y) + μ x y ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2: 2x -2y = λ(y + z -x - z) + μ(y z -x z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Simplify: 2(x - y)= λ(y - x) + μ z(y -x) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: [2 + λ + μ z](x - y)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, either x=y, or 2 + λ + μ z=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, subtract equation 1 -3: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 2x -2z=λ(y + z -x - y) + μ(y z -x y) Simplify: 2(x - z)=λ(z -x) + μ y(z -x) Factor: [2 + λ + μ y](x - z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, either x=z, or 2 + λ + μ y=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, subtract equation 2-3: 2y -2z=λ(x + z -x - y) + μ(x z -x y) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Simplify: 2(y - z)=λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y) Factor: [2 + λ + μ x](y - z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, either y=z, or 2 + λ + μ x=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, in summary, either variables are equal, or 2 + λ + μ times the difference equals zero. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, either variables are equal, or 2 + λ + μ times (difference of variables)=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, in the case where variables are not equal, we have 2 + λ + μ times (difference)=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But since this must hold for all pairs, unless all variables are equal, which would require λ and μ to be related accordingly. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, but if variables are not equal, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] then 2 + λ + μ times (x - y)=0, and similarly for other differences. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But if x ≠ y and x ≠ z and y ≠ z, then we have: 2 + λ + μ z=0 2 + λ + μ y=0 2 + λ + μ x=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Subtracting the first and second equations: (2 + λ + μ z) - (2 + λ + μ y)=0 ⇒ μ(z - y)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, since z ≠ y, this implies μ=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, subtracting first and third equations: ["end-section"] ["deduction"] μ(x - z)=0, since x ≠ z, μ=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, μ=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Then, from equation 1: 2x= λ(y + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From equation 2: 2y=λ(x + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] From equation 3: 2z=λ(x + y) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, with μ=0, we have: 2x=λ(y + z) 2y=λ(x + z) 2z=λ(x + y) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, from equations 1 and 2: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 2x=λ(y + z) 2y=λ(x + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Divide equation 1 by equation 2: (2x)/(2y)= [λ(y + z)]/[λ(x + z)] ⇒ x/y=(y + z)/(x + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Cross multiply: x(x + z)=y(y + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] from equations 2 and 3: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 2y=λ(x + z) 2z=λ(x + y) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Divide equation 2 by equation 3: (2y)/(2z)= [λ(x + z)]/[λ(x + y)] ⇒ y/z=(x + z)/(x + y) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Cross multiply: y(x + y)=z(x + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, now we have two equations: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] 1. x(x + z)=y(y + z) 2. y(x + y)=z(x + z) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me denote equation 1: x² + x z = y² + y z Equation 2: y x + y² = z x + z² ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let me rearrange equation 1: x² - y² + x z - y z=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: (x - y)(x + y) + z(x - y)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: (x - y)(x + y + z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, since x ≠ y, we have x + y + z=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But x, y, z are positive, so this is impossible. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the only possibility is that x=y. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Similarly, from equation 2: y x + y² = z x + z² Rearrange: y x - z x + y² - z²=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: x(y - z) + (y - z)(y + z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Factor: (y - z)(x + y + z)=0 ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Again, since y ≠ z, we have x + y + z=0, which is impossible. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the only possibility is x=y=z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But if x=y=z, then the box is a cube. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But earlier, we saw that a cube with surface area 54 would have edge length 3, but volume would be 27, which is larger than 23. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, a cube is not a solution here. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the maximum S occurs when two variables are equal, either x=y or y=z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] We saw that when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=41.0625. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] When y=z=2, x=5.75, same result. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But earlier, when I tried to set y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, I found a larger S=68.832, but that was under the assumption that y=z, which led to a cubic equation with roots y=2 and y≈3.899. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, but in that case, when y=z=1.7037, that wasn't a solution to the cubic equation. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, perhaps that was an error. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, when we set y=z, we had to solve y³ -27 y +46=0, which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, y cannot be 1.7037 if we set y=z. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, that case is not valid because when y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] it doesn't satisfy the surface area and volume constraints. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["backtracking"] but earlier, when I tried to set x=100, I found that it's impossible because the quadratic equation had no real roots. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps the maximum S is achieved when y=z=2, x=5.75, giving S=41.0625. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the maximum space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, so radius r=6.437/2≈3.218. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 41.0625 is 657/16, so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] but that conflicts with the direct computation from x=y=2, z=5.75. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, I think the confusion comes from the fact that 41.0625 is S, so sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] but in reality, when x=y=2, z=5.75, sqrt(S)=sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, so which one is correct? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, no, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 657/16=41.0625, so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] which is less than 6.437. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Therefore, the exact value is sqrt(657)/4, but when we compute from x=y=2, z=5.75, we get sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but 41.0625 is 657/16, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 6.257 is less than 6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, this is a contradiction. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, perhaps the issue is that 657/16 is 41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] but when computed from x=y=2, z=5.75, sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] so which is correct? ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, no, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so sqrt(41.0625)=6.437. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 657/16=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 6.257 squared is≈41.06, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is correct. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but when I compute sqrt(41.0625), ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] that's incorrect because 6.437 squared is≈41.1, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but 41.0625 is 657/16. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, no, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] 6.437 squared is≈41.1, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is close to 41.0625. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but 6.437 squared= (6 +0.437)^2=36 + 2*6*0.437 +0.437²≈36 +5.224 +0.190≈41.414, ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] which is larger than 41.0625. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] let's compute sqrt(41.0625): sqrt(41.0625)=sqrt(41 +0.0625)=sqrt(41 +1/16)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4≈25.03/4≈6.257. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but 6.257 squared≈41.06, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] which is correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But when I computed sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] but earlier, I thought it was 6.437. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] no, 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so sqrt(41.0625)=6.257. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] perhaps I made a mistake in adding. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, 4 +4=8, 8 +33.0625=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so yes, sqrt(41.0625)=6.257. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But earlier, I thought of sqrt(41.0625)=6.437, ["end-section"] ["uncertainty-estimation"] but that was incorrect. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, sqrt(S)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so radius r=6.257/2≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But when I computed for x=y=2, z=5.75, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] the space diagonal was sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.257, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] which is correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, r=6.257/2≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] But when I tried setting y=z=1.7037, x=7.94, I found S≈68.832, ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] but that was incorrect because ["end-section"]

["deduction"] in reality, y=z=1.7037 doesn't satisfy the surface area equation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so that case was invalid because when I set y=z, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] it must satisfy y³ -27 y +46=0, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] which only has roots y=2 and y≈3.899. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, the only valid case is when y=z=2, x=5.75, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] giving S=41.0625, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] space diagonal≈6.257, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] radius≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the minimal r is sqrt(657)/8≈3.128. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] But 657 and 8: 657 divided by 8 is 82.125, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] which is not integer. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] but 657= 3*13*17, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] and 8 is 2^3, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] so they are co-prime. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, p=657, q=64, p+q=721. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["backtracking"] but hold on. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] no, r= sqrt(S)/2= sqrt(657/16)/2= sqrt(657)/4 /2= sqrt(657)/8. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Wait, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] no, hold on, sqrt(S)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] so r= sqrt(657)/8. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Yes, ["end-section"] ["deduction"] so r squared is 657/64, so p=657, q=64, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] which are co-prime since 657=3*13*17, 64=2^6, no common factors. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Thus, p+q=657+64=721. ["end-section"]

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{721}
