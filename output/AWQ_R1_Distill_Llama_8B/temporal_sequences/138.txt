Alright, let's try to figure out when Nancy could have gone to the soccer field. I'll go through each piece of information step by step.

First, Nancy woke up at 5am. That means she was up and about by 5am.

Next, William saw Nancy attending class at the school from 5am to 11am. So, during that time, Nancy was at school.

Leslie saw Nancy waiting at the train station from 11am to 12pm. So, after her class, Nancy went to the train station and waited there until 12pm.

Then, Nancy saw herself reading at the library from 3pm to 8pm. That means she was at the library from 3pm to 8pm.

The soccer field was closed after 8pm, which suggests that it's only open during certain hours, and after 8pm, it's closed.

Now, we need to find the time between when Nancy could have gone to the soccer field. Let's look at the timeline:

- 5am to 11am: At school
- 11am to 12pm: At the train station
- 12pm to 3pm: Not mentioned where she was
- 3pm to 8pm: At the library

So, the only time when Nancy wasn't at school, the train station, or the library is between 12pm and 3pm. That's when she could have possibly gone to the soccer field.

Looking at the options:

(A) 3pm to 8pm: She was at the library during this time, so she couldn't have gone to the soccer field then.

(B) 12pm to 3pm: This fits with the timeline because she wasn't at school, the train station, or the library during this period.

(C) 5am to 11am: She was at school during this time.

(D) 11am to 12pm: She was at the train station during this time.

So, the correct answer is (B) 12pm to 3pm.
</think>

The correct answer is **(B) 12pm to 3pm**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Nancy's activities throughout the day:**
   - **5am to 11am:** Attending class at the school.
   - **11am to 12pm:** Waiting at the train station.
   - **12pm to 3pm:** No specific activity mentioned; this is the only unaccounted time.
   - **3pm to 8pm:** Reading at the library.

2. **Determine the possible time for the soccer field visit:**
   - Since the soccer field was closed after 8pm, Nancy must have visited before 8pm.
   - The only available window is between 12pm and 3pm when she wasn't at school, the train station, or the library.

3. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **(A) 3pm to 8pm:** She was at the library, so this is incorrect.
   - **(B) 12pm to 3pm:** This fits the timeline and is the correct period.
   - **(C) 5am to 11am:** She was at school, so this is incorrect.
   - **(D) 11am to 12pm:** She was at the train station, so this is incorrect.

**Answer:** (B) 12pm to 3pm
