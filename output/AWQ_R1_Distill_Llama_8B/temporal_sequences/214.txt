Alright, let's try to figure out when Jason could have gone to the physics classroom. I'll start by listing out all the information given and then see how it fits together.

First, Jason woke up at 5am. So, that's the earliest time we know he was up and about.

Next, Leslie saw Jason buying a bike at the bike shop from 5am to 9am. That means during that time, Jason was at the bike shop. So, from 5am to 9am, Jason was likely occupied with buying the bike.

Then, James saw Jason stretching at a yoga studio from 1pm to 8pm. So, after 1pm, Jason was at the yoga studio stretching. That means he must have been at the yoga studio during that time.

William saw Jason taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 8pm to 9pm. So, right after the yoga studio visit, Jason was taking photos.

Richard saw Jason getting a coffee at the cafe from 9pm to 10pm. So, after taking photos, Jason went for coffee.

The physics classroom was closed after 10pm, which is interesting. That means Jason couldn't have gone to the physics classroom after 10pm because it was closed.

Now, let's try to piece together Jason's schedule.

He wakes up at 5am and spends time buying a bike until 9am. So, from 5am to 9am, he's at the bike shop.

After that, from 9am onward, he's free. But wait, James saw him at the yoga studio from 1pm to 8pm. So, that means Jason must have left the bike shop at some point after 9am to go to the yoga studio.

But wait, William saw him taking photos from 8pm to 9pm, and Richard saw him getting coffee from 9pm to 10pm. So, after the yoga studio visit, he was taking photos and then coffee.

Now, the physics classroom was closed after 10pm, so Jason couldn't have gone there after 10pm.

So, when was he free? From 9am to 1pm, he was probably free because he was at the bike shop until 9am and then went to the yoga studio from 1pm to 8pm.

Wait, but if he was at the yoga studio from 1pm to 8pm, he couldn't have been at the physics classroom during that time.

But the physics classroom was closed after 10pm, so he could have gone before 10pm.

But he was at the yoga studio until 8pm, so he must have left the yoga studio at 8pm to take photos until 9pm, and then coffee until 10pm.

So, the time he was free before going to the yoga studio was from 9am to 1pm.

Therefore, he could have gone to the physics classroom during that time, which is 9am to 1pm.

So, the answer should be option (B) 9am to 1pm.

Jason was free from 9am to 1pm, so he could have gone to the physics classroom during that time.

**Answer: (B)**
