Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Richard could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll take it step by step.

First, Richard wakes up at 10am. That's our starting point.

Then, Jason saw Richard waiting at the train station from 10am to 12pm. So, Richard was at the train station during that time.

After that, Sean saw Richard walking in the garden from 12pm to 3pm. So, Richard was in the garden during this period.

Then, David saw Richard fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 5pm. So, Richard was at the electronic store during these hours.

Now, the coffee shop was closed after 7pm. So, Richard couldn't have gone to the coffee shop after 7pm.

Let's list out Richard's activities:

- 10am to 12pm: At the train station.
- 12pm to 3pm: In the garden.
- 3pm to 5pm: At the electronic store.

The coffee shop is only open until 7pm, but after 7pm, it's closed. So, Richard could have gone to the coffee shop only before 7pm.

Looking at Richard's schedule, he was at the electronic store from 3pm to 5pm. Since the coffee shop was open until 7pm, he could have gone to the coffee shop during his free time before 5pm.

So, between 3pm and 5pm, Richard was at the electronic store. Therefore, the time he could have gone to the coffee shop would be before 3pm or after 5pm, but after 5pm, the coffee shop is already closed by 7pm.

Wait, but the coffee shop was closed after 7pm, so it might have been open earlier. Let me clarify.

If the coffee shop was closed after 7pm, that means it was open before 7pm. So, Richard could have gone to the coffee shop at any time before 7pm.

Looking back at Richard's schedule:

- From 10am to 12pm: At the train station.
- From 12pm to 3pm: In the garden.
- From 3pm to 5pm: At the electronic store.

So, the only time Richard was free before 7pm is between 5pm and 7pm.

Wait, but between 5pm and 7pm, Richard was at the electronic store until 5pm, so he could have gone to the coffee shop after 5pm but before 7pm.

But the options given are:

(A) 5pm to 7pm
(B) 3pm to 5pm
(C) 12pm to 3pm
(D) 10am to 12pm

So, the only overlapping time when Richard could have gone to the coffee shop is between 5pm and 7pm, which is option A.

But wait, Richard was at the electronic store until 5pm, so he could have gone to the coffee shop after 5pm but before 7pm. So, the correct answer is (A) 5pm to 7pm.

But let me double-check.

Richard's timeline:

- 10am to 12pm: Train station.
- 12pm to 3pm: Garden.
- 3pm to 5pm: Electronic store.
- After 5pm: Not specified, but coffee shop closed at 7pm.

So, the only free time Richard has after 5pm is until 7pm. Therefore, he could have gone to the coffee shop between 5pm and 7pm.

So, the correct answer is (A) 5pm to 7pm.

The correct answer is (A) 5pm to 7pm.

Answer: (A)
