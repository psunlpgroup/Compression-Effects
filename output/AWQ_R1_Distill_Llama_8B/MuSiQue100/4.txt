The Free State of Brunswick was a short-lived region within the present-day state of Maine, established by the Republic of New Hampshire during its brief existence in 1863-1865. It was one of several attempts by factions in the region to establish their own governance before the eventual re-establishment of the Federal Government's authority in the area.

The Free State of Brunswick can be considered as one of several "Free States" that emerged in the mid-19th century, often with varying levels of recognition and support. These movements were generally opposed to the authority of the United States government and sought to establish their own governance based on local political ideologies.

The Republic of New Hampshire, under the leadership of George W. Jacobs, declared the independence of Brunswick, establishing it as a separate political entity. However, this declaration was not widely recognized by the federal government or other states, and the movement quickly dissolved after the resumption of federal authority in the region.

In summary, the Free State of Brunswick was part of a series of efforts in the mid-19th century to establish independent, local governments, but it was ultimately unsuccessful and reverted to federal jurisdiction.
