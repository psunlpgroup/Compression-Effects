Let's analyze the timeline step by step.

1. **Sarah's schedule:**
   - She wakes up at 11am.
   - She is seen working at the office from 11am to 2pm by Lisa.
   - Then, she is spotted reading at the library from 2pm to 4pm by Hannah.
   - After that, she is occupied fixing their computer at the electronic store from 4pm to 7pm by Elizabeth.

2. **Art Show timings:**
   - The art show is closed after 9pm.

3. **Possible times Sarah could have gone to the art show:**
   - Since Sarah is occupied from 11am to 7pm, she doesn't have time to attend the art show during these hours.
   - The latest she could have gone is between 7pm and 9pm, before the art show closes.
