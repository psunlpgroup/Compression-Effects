Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Mark could have gone to the clothing store. So, Mark's day starts at 5 am, and we have a few different people who saw him at different times and places. Let's break it down step by step.

First, Mark wakes up at 5 am. Then, Andrew saw Mark taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 5 am to 6 am. So, that means Mark was there from 5 am to 6 am. Okay, that's one interval.

Next, William saw Mark waiting at the train station from 9 am to 6 pm. So, that's a longer period—9 am to 6 pm. So, Mark was at the train station during that time.

Then, Ashley saw Mark buying a bike at the bike shop from 6 pm to 10 pm. So, that's another interval from 6 pm to 10 pm.

Now, the clothing store was closed after 10 pm. So, that means the clothing store was open before 10 pm, but after 10 pm, it's closed.

So, we need to figure out when Mark could have gone to the clothing store. Let's see.

First, Mark was taking photos from 5 am to 6 am. So, that's the first hour. Then, from 6 am to 9 am, there's a gap where no one saw him. So, between 6 am and 9 am, he might have been doing something else, like going to the clothing store or other errands.

Then, from 9 am to 6 pm, William saw him at the train station. So, that's a big chunk of time—9 am to 6 pm. So, during that time, he was at the train station, so he wouldn't have been at the clothing store.

After that, from 6 pm to 10 pm, Ashley saw him buying a bike. So, he was at the bike shop during that time. So, he couldn't have been at the clothing store then.

The clothing store was closed after 10 pm, so he couldn't have gone after 10 pm.

So, the only possible time he could have gone to the clothing store is between 6 am and 9 am, when no one saw him.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, from 5 am to 6 am, he was taking photos. Then, from 6 am to 9 am, no one saw him. So, that's a two-hour window where he could have gone to the clothing store.

Then, from 9 am to 6 pm, he was at the train station, so no time for the clothing store.

From 6 pm to 10 pm, he was buying a bike, so again, no time for the clothing store.

After 10 pm, the store was closed, so that's out.

So, the only possible time is between 6 am and 9 am.

Looking at the options, that's option (B) 6am to 9am.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The clothing store could have been open during the time when he was at the train station, but since he was at the train station from 9 am to 6 pm, he wouldn't have had time to go to the clothing store during that time.

So, yeah, the only window is between 6 am and 9 am.

So, the answer should be (B) 6am to 9am.
</think>

The clothing store was closed after 10 pm, so Mark couldn't have gone after that. The only available time when he wasn't seen by anyone else is between 6 am and 9 am.

**Answer:** (B) 6am to 9am
