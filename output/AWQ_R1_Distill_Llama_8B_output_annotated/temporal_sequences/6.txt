["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out during which time Ashley could have gone to the bookstore. I'll need to analyze the timeline step by step. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, Ashley wakes up at 7am. That's the starting point. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Leslie saw Ashley buying a bike at the bike shop from 11am to 12pm. ["deduction"] So, during this time, Ashley was at the bike shop. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Susan saw Ashley working out at the gym from 12pm to 4pm. ["deduction"] So, from 12pm to 4pm, Ashley was at the gym. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Elizabeth saw Ashley waiting at the train station from 4pm to 7pm. ["deduction"] So, between 4pm and 7pm, Ashley was at the train station. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Emily saw Ashley taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7pm to 9pm. ["deduction"] So, during this time, Ashley was taking photos. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The bookstore was closed after 9pm. ["deduction"] So, the latest time Ashley could have gone to the bookstore is before 9pm. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] Now, let's see when Ashley was not at the bike shop, gym, train station, or taking photos. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 7am to 11am: ["deduction"] Ashley was not seen by anyone except possibly at home. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 11am to 12pm: Ashley was at the bike shop. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 12pm to 4pm: Ashley was at the gym. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 4pm to 7pm: Ashley was at the train station. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 7pm to 9pm: Ashley was taking photos. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the only time when Ashley wasn't occupied as per the observations is between 7am to 11am. ["deduction"] Therefore, this is the only possible window when Ashley could have gone to the bookstore. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Options: (A) 7pm to 9pm (B) 11am to 12pm (C) 12pm to 4pm (D) 7am to 11am ["deduction"] The correct answer is (D) 7am to 11am. ["end-section"]
