Alright, let's try to break down this question step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it one piece at a time.

First, the question mentions "Taito Kantonen." I'm not immediately familiar with this term, so I'll need to look it up. From what I find, Taito Kantonen is also known as Taito Nishikawa, a Japanese artist known for his works in the horror and supernatural genres. He's associated with the "Shin Nippon Kaidan" (Strange Japanese Stories) series, which are graphic and often involve violent themes.

Next, the question refers to "the death city." This phrase suggests a location associated with death or a place where significant mortality events occur. It's not immediately clear which city this is, so I'll need to connect it with the context of the first part.

The question then asks when this "death city" became the capital of a US state. That's a bit confusing because the United States has 50 states, each with its own capital. The mention of a "statue being the title of the various Latin Mother goddess" adds another layer. A Latin Mother goddess could be referring to a deity from Roman mythology, like Venus, Juno, or Minerva, each representing different aspects of motherhood.

Putting it all together, the question is asking about a city in the US that is the capital of a state, which is also known as a "death city," and which has a statue related to a Latin Mother goddess. Given that Taito Kantonen is associated with horror themes, it's possible the "death city" is a reference to a specific city, but without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint.

However, considering the mention of a Latin Mother goddess statue, it might be referencing a specific cultural or historical reference. Perhaps it's a metaphorical term rather than a literal city name. If I think about US capitals, cities like Washington D.C., Austin, or Salem come to mind. Salem, for instance, has historical connections to the Salem witch trials, which could tie into themes of death and the supernatural.

Given that Taito Kantonen's works involve horror and the supernatural, it's plausible that the "death city" refers to Salem, Massachusetts, which is the capital of Massachusetts and has a history tied to death and witchcraft. Additionally, Massachusetts has a statue or landmarks that might be associated with a Latin Mother goddess, though I'm not sure which one specifically.

Considering all this, I would say the death city in question is Salem, Massachusetts, which became the capital of the US state Massachusetts in 1787. The statue reference might be to one of the many historical or cultural markers in Salem related to its past, possibly tying into the theme of motherhood or a specific deity.

However, without explicit connections to a specific Latin Mother goddess statue, this remains speculative. But based on the themes of horror and the supernatural associated with Taito Kantonen and Salem's history, this seems like the most plausible answer.
