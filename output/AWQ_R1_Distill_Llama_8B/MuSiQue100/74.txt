Alright, so I need to figure out the name of the castle where the performer of "When I Was a Boy" was born. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should identify who the performer of "When I Was a Boy" is. I know that this song is quite famous, so I'm pretty sure it's by someone well-known. I think it's either Bruce Springsteen or someone else. Wait, no, I recall that Bruce Springsteen has a song called "Born to Run," but the one mentioned here is "When I Was a Boy." Hmm, maybe it's a different artist.

Oh, right! I think it's Bruce Springsteen's brother, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. I believe the song "When I Was a Boy" is by Bruce Springsteen. Yes, that's correct. He released it in 1975 on his album "Born to Run."

Now, the question is about the castle where he was born. So, I need to find out where Bruce Springsteen was born. I think he was born in New Jersey, but I'm not certain about the exact location. Maybe it's a small town there. I've heard that he's from a place called Freehold, New Jersey. So, he was born in Freehold.

Next, the question asks for the name of the castle in the place of his birth. So, I need to find out if there's a castle associated with Freehold, NJ. I'm not sure if there's an actual castle there, but I recall that sometimes places have historical structures or landmarks with castle-like features. Maybe it's a historical building or a notable landmark.

Wait, I think I've heard of a castle in Freehold before. It might be called the "Castle on the Hill." That sounds familiar. Let me try to remember. Yes, I believe Bruce Springsteen's birthplace, Freehold, New Jersey, has a castle called "Castle on the Hill." It's not a traditional castle, but it's a prominent structure in the area.

So, putting it all together, the performer of "When I Was a Boy" is Bruce Springsteen, he was born in Freehold, New Jersey, and the castle there is called "Castle on the Hill."

I think that's the answer, but I should double-check to make sure. Maybe I'm confusing it with another place. Let me think again. Bruce Springsteen's birthplace is indeed Freehold, and there's a notable landmark there called Castle on the Hill. It's a significant building in the town, so that must be the one referred to in the question.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the castle is "Castle on the Hill" in Freehold, New Jersey.
