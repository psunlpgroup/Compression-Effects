Alright, let's try to figure out when Emily could have gone to the bakery. First, I'll list out all the information given and see how it fits together.

Emily woke up at 5am. That's her earliest activity of the day.

Then, Nancy saw Emily sitting on a rooftop from 6am to 7am. So, that means Emily was on the rooftop during that time.

Next, Betty saw Emily reading at the library from 7am to 8am. So, after the rooftop, Emily went to the library.

Then, Jason saw Emily buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 6pm. So, she was at the deli for a long time, from 8am until 6pm.

After that, David saw Emily attending class at the school from 6pm to 7pm. So, she went to class right after lunch.

Then, Samantha saw Emily driving to the water park from 7pm to 10pm. So, she left the school and drove to the water park, arriving there by 10pm.

Finally, the bakery was closed after 10pm. That means the bakery didn't operate after 10pm.

So, we need to find a time when Emily was free to go to the bakery. Let's see her schedule:

- 5am: Woke up.
- 6am-7am: On the rooftop.
- 7am-8am: At the library.
- 8am-6pm: At the deli.
- 6pm-7pm: At school.
- 7pm-10pm: Driving to the water park.

Wait, so when was Emily not occupied? Let's check each time period.

From 5am to 6am: She just woke up, so maybe she was at home. But Nancy saw her at 6am. So, maybe she left home around 5am.

From 6am-7am: On the rooftop.

From 7am-8am: At the library.

From 8am-6pm: At the deli.

From 6pm-7pm: At school.

From 7pm-10pm: Driving.

So, when was she free? Between 10pm and when? But the bakery was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't go after that.

Wait, maybe she went earlier. Let me check the times again.

She was at the deli until 6pm. Then, she went to school from 6pm to 7pm. So, she didn't have time to go to the bakery during that time.

Before that, she was at the library from 7am to 8am. Then, she was at the deli until 6pm.

Wait, could she have gone to the bakery between 5am and 6am? That's option A.

But she just woke up at 5am, and Nancy saw her at 6am on the rooftop. So, she must have left home around 5am or just after.

So, she might have gone to the bakery right after waking up, before Nancy saw her.

Therefore, she could have gone to the bakery between 5am and 6am, which is option A.

But let me make sure. The bakery was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone later than that.

She didn't have any free time after 7pm because she was either at school or driving to the water park.

So, the only possible time she could have gone to the bakery is between 5am and 6am.

Therefore, the answer should be option A.
</think>

The correct answer is (A) 5am to 6am.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Emily woke up at 5am.
2. She was seen on the rooftop by Nancy from 6am to 7am.
3. Therefore, Emily left her home after 5am but before 6am to possibly visit the bakery.
4. The next sightings start at 6am, so she must have gone to the bakery between 5am and 6am.

Answer: (A) 5am to 6am
