["initializing"] 
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] 
Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] 
First, let's note that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300. So, they can range from 0 up to 300, but their total must be exactly 300. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
The second equation is a bit more complicated: it's the sum of all possible products where one variable is squared and multiplied by the other two. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, it's a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] 
Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow? ["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Let me write it out: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are different variables. Since there are three variables, each pair can be multiplied in two different ways (x²y and y²x). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the entire expression is the sum over all x²y for x ≠ y. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, is there a way to express this sum in terms of (a + b + c) and (ab + bc + ca)? Maybe. Let me think. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
I recall that (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) equals a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 3abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, if I subtract 3abc, I get the expression we have. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
That is: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Given that, our equation becomes: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But we know that a + b + c = 300. So, substituting that in: 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me write this as: 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide both sides by 3 to simplify: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, now we have: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. ["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Maybe I can denote some variables here. Let me let S = a + b + c = 300, and Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, our equation becomes: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
But we also know from the theory of symmetric sums that for variables a, b, c, the following holds: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But I don't know if that helps here. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, perhaps I can express Q in terms of S and something else. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, but we have Q and P related through 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
But I also know that in the realm of symmetric polynomials, Q is related to S and the squares of the variables. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Wait, another thought: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps two of them are equal? ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Or maybe all three are equal? Let me test that. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Suppose all three variables are equal: a = b = c. Then, since a + b + c = 300, each variable would be 100. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let's plug into the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6*(a²b) since all are equal. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
So, 6*(100²*100) = 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Hey, that works! ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, a = b = c = 100 is a solution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, at least one triple (100, 100, 100) satisfies both equations. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But are there more solutions? Let's see. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Then, let's set a = b, so we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Then, let's compute Q and P. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Q = ab + bc + ca = a² + a c + a c = a² + 2ac. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, P = a b c = a² c. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, plug into the equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Substitute Q and P: 100(a² + 2ac) - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me write this as: 100a² + 200ac - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Factor out a²: a²(100 - c) + 200ac = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Hmm, but c = 300 - 2a, so let's substitute that in: a²(100 - (300 - 2a)) + 200a(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Simplify inside the first term: 100 - 300 + 2a = -200 + 2a. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the equation becomes: a²(-200 + 2a) + 200a(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me compute each term: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
First term: a²(-200 + 2a) = -200a² + 2a³. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Second term: 200a(300 - 2a) = 60,000a - 400a². ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Adding them together: (-200a² + 2a³) + (60,000a - 400a²) = 2a³ - 500a² + 60,000a. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Set this equal to 2,000,000: 2a³ - 500a² + 60,000a = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide both sides by 2 to simplify: a³ - 250a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, we have the cubic equation: a³ - 250a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Hmm, solving a cubic equation. That might be tricky, but maybe we can factor it. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Let me try to factor it. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let's denote f(a) = a³ - 250a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, which are integers. So, possible integer roots could be divisors of 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me test a=100: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
f(100) = 1,000,000 - 25,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = (1,000,000 - 1,000,000) + (-25,000,000 + 3,000,000) = 0 - 22,000,000 ≠ 0. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Not a root. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Try a=200: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
f(200) = 8,000,000 - 250*(40,000) + 30,000*200 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, 200³ = 8,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
250a² = 250*(200)^2 = 250*40,000 = 10,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
30,000a = 30,000*200 = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, f(200) = 8,000,000 - 10,000,000 + 6,000,000 - 1,000,000 = (8 - 10 + 6 - 1) million = 3 million ≠ 0. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Not a root. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Try a=50: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
f(50) = 125,000 - 62,500 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, 50³=125,000; 250*50²=250*2,500=625,000; 30,000*50=1,500,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, f(50)=125,000 - 625,000 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000 = (125 - 625 + 1,500 - 1,000) = (125 - 625 is -500, -500 + 1,500 is 1,000, 1,000 - 1,000 is 0. So, f(50)=0. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Yes! a=50 is a root. So, (a - 50) is a factor. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, let's perform polynomial division or factor it out. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Divide f(a) by (a - 50): ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Using synthetic division: Coefficients: 1 | -250 | 30,000 | -1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide by (a - 50): Bring down the 1. Multiply 1 by 50: 50. Add to -250: -200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Multiply -200 by 50: -10,000. Add to 30,000: 20,000. Multiply 20,000 by 50: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the cubic factors as (a - 50)(a² - 200a + 20,000). ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Now, let's factor the quadratic: a² - 200a + 20,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Looking for two numbers that multiply to 20,000 and add to -200. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Hmm, 20,000 is 200*100, but 200 + 100 = 300, not 200. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, 20,000: factors like 50 and 400: 50*400=20,000, 50+400=450, not 200. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, maybe 200 and 100: but 200+100=300. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, maybe 200 is too big. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me compute discriminant: 200² - 4*1*20,000=40,000 - 80,000= -40,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Negative discriminant, so quadratic has complex roots. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, only real root is a=50. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, the only positive integer solution for a is 50. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, if a=50, then c=300 - 2a=300 - 100=200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, c=200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, the triple is (50,50,200). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But wait, since a and b are equal, so (50,50,200). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But hold on, 50 + 50 + 200=300, that's correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, this is another solution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, now, we have two solutions: (100,100,100) and (50,50,200). ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, since we considered a=b, but c can be different. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But in this case, c=200, which is different from a and b. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, what if I consider other cases where two variables are equal? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
For example, maybe a=c, so b is different. Would that give another solution? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But in our previous case, we assumed a=b, which led us to a solution. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
If we instead assume a=c, we might get another solution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me check. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, but in reality, the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, so whether I set a=b or a=c, it's similar. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the solution (50,50,200) is equivalent to (50,200,50) or (200,50,50). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, actually, all these permutations are different solutions. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But hold on, in the case where two variables are equal, do we get multiple triples, or just one unique solution? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, the triple (50,50,200) is distinct from (100,100,100). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, how many such triples are there? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
If two variables are equal, then the number of distinct triples is equal to the number of permutations, which is 3: since the third variable is different. So, each case where two variables are equal gives three triples. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But in our earlier case, a=50, so (50,50,200), but since a, b, c can be arranged in any order, we have three triples: (50,50,200), (50,200,50), and (200,50,50). ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, in the original equation, does the order matter? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Because we're counting triples (a,b,c), so order does matter. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, each permutation is a different triple. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But wait, hold on: in our problem, are we counting ordered triples or unordered? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
The question says "the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", so it's ordered. So, yes, (50,50,200), (50,200,50), and (200,50,50) are distinct triples. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, if all three variables are equal, there's only one triple: (100,100,100). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, total so far: 4 triples. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, are there any other solutions where none of the variables are equal? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
That is, solutions where a, b, c are all distinct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, we have found solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different, and the solution where all are equal. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But is there a solution where all three are distinct? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Let me check. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Suppose a, b, c are all distinct. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Then, I need to see if such triples can satisfy the given equation. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But before that, let me compute what is Q and P in the case of a=50, b=50, c=200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute Q = ab + bc + ca = 50*50 + 50*200 + 50*200 = 2500 + 10,000 + 10,000 = 25,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute P = a b c = 50*50*200=5,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, 100Q - P = 100*25,000 - 5,000,000 = 2,500,000 - 5,000,000 = -2,500,000, which is not equal to 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, that can't be. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, hold on, that contradicts our earlier substitution. Did I do something wrong? ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, no, wait: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, when a=50, b=50, c=200, let's compute 100Q - P. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Q = ab + bc + ca = 50*50 +50*200 +50*200=2500 +10,000 +10,000=25,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
P = 50*50*200=5,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P = 100*25,000 - 5,000,000 = 2,500,000 - 5,000,000 = -2,500,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But in our earlier equation, 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, this suggests that something is wrong. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, no, actually, we had: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
From the initial equation: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But for a=50, b=50, c=200: Compute a + b + c=50+50+200=300. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute ab + bc + ca=50*50 +50*200 +50*200=2500 +10,000 +10,000=25,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute 3abc=3*50*50*200=3*5,000,000=15,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300*25,000=7,500,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, 7,500,000 - 15,000,000= -7,500,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So, that's inconsistent. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, so something is wrong here. Because when I set a=50, I thought it satisfied the equation, but it seems like it doesn't. Wait, let's go back. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Earlier, we had: After substituting a=50 into the cubic equation, we found that it's a root, so it should satisfy the equation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, let me recast the equation: After substituting a=50, c=200, let's compute the original expression: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since a=50, b=50, c=200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute each term: a²b = 50²*50 = 2500*50=125,000. a²c=50²*200=2500*200=500,000. b²a=50²*50=125,000. b²c=50²*200=500,000. c²a=200²*50=40,000*50=2,000,000. c²b=200²*50=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Adding all together: 125,000 + 500,000 + 125,000 + 500,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 125,000 + 500,000 = 625,000. 625,000 + 125,000 = 750,000. 750,000 + 500,000 = 1,250,000. 1,250,000 + 2,000,000 = 3,250,000. 3,250,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,250,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, that's 5,250,000, not 6,000,000. So, it doesn't satisfy the equation. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, so that's a problem. So, even though a=50 is a root of the cubic equation, plugging back into the original equation doesn't satisfy it. So, something is wrong in my approach. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in substitution. ["end-section"]

["initializing"]
Wait, let me retrace. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
We started with the equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Where Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
We then set a = b, so c = 300 - 2a. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, we expressed Q and P in terms of a: Q = a² + 2ac. P = a²c. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, substituting into 100Q - P = 2,000,000: 100(a² + 2ac) - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which simplifies to: 100a² + 200ac - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, substituting c = 300 - 2a: 100a² + 200a(300 - 2a) - a²(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, hold on, that step where I substituted c = 300 - 2a into the equation 100a² + 200ac - a²c. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, actually, in my earlier steps, I think I made a miscalculation. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, let me re-express: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
After substituting c = 300 - 2a, into 100a² + 200ac - a²c. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100a² + 200a(300 - 2a) - a²(300 - 2a). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that would be: 100a² + (60,000a - 400a²) - (300a² - 2a³). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute term by term: 100a² + 60,000a - 400a² - 300a² + 2a³. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Combine like terms: 100a² - 400a² - 300a² = (100 - 400 - 300)a² = (-600)a². ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, we have: -600a² + 60,000a + 2a³. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Set equal to 2,000,000: 2a³ - 600a² + 60,000a = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide both sides by 2: a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, earlier, I had divided by 2, so it was: a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but when I tested a=50, plugging into this equation: 50³ - 300*50² + 30,000*50 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 125,000 - 300*2,500 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is 125,000 - 750,000 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute step by step: 125,000 - 750,000 = -625,000. -625,000 + 1,500,000 = 875,000. 875,000 - 1,000,000 = -125,000 ≠ 0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, a=50 is not a root of this equation. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But earlier, I thought it was a root because I had a different cubic equation. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, this suggests that my substitution was wrong. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, no, let me check again. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, when I set a = b, I had: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But Q = a² + 2ac. P = a²c. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100(a² + 2ac) - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is 100a² + 200ac - a²c = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, substituting c = 300 - 2a: 100a² + 200a(300 - 2a) - a²(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so expanding: 100a² + 60,000a - 400a² - 300a² + 2a³. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Combine like terms: 100a² - 400a² - 300a² = (100 - 400 - 300)a² = (-600)a². ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, 2a³ - 600a² + 60,000a = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide both sides by 2: a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, so I think my earlier division by 2 was incorrect because I didn't factor correctly. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the correct cubic equation is a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so when I thought I had a root at a=50, I was wrong because I had incorrectly factored the cubic. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, let me try again to factor this correct cubic equation. ["end-section"]

["initializing"]
f(a) = a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me try possible integer roots. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Possible roots are factors of 1,000,000: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000, etc. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me try a=100: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
f(100)=1,000,000 - 300*(10,000) + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000= (1,000,000 - 1,000,000) + (-3,000,000 + 3,000,000)= 0 + 0=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, a=100 is a root. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Great! ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, (a - 100) is a factor. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Now, perform polynomial division: Divide f(a) by (a - 100): ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Using synthetic division: Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Divide by (a - 100): Bring down the 1. Multiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200. Multiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000. Multiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Add to -1,000,000: 0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, f(a) factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000). ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Now, factor the quadratic: a² - 200a + 10,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Find two numbers that multiply to 10,000 and add to -200. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Hmm, 200 and 50: 200*50=10,000; 200+50=250, which is not 200. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Wait, 100 and 100: 100*100=10,000; 100+100=200. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But we have -200a, so both numbers are negative: -100 and -100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, the quadratic factors as (a - 100)^2. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, let me verify: (a - 100)^2 = a² - 200a + 10,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Yes, that's correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a - 100)^2 = (a - 100)^3. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but that would mean that the only root is a=100, with multiplicity three. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But that can't be, because when we tested a=100, it satisfies the equation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, but let's check: If a=100, then c=300 - 2a=300 - 200=100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, c=100, which makes a=b=c=100, which is the all-equal case. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the cubic equation only has a=100 as a real root, with multiplicity three. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, the only solution when two variables are equal is a=100, which gives the triple (100,100,100). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, in this case, there is only one triple where two variables are equal, which is the all-equal case. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so that suggests that the only solutions are either all variables equal to 100, or all variables distinct? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But earlier, when I tried (50,50,200), it didn't satisfy the equation. So, perhaps there are no solutions where two variables are equal except when all three are equal. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But that seems odd. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, when I set a=b, I get c=300 - 2a. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, I substituted into the equation, and ended up with the cubic equation which only had a=100 as a root. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that suggests that the only solution where two variables are equal is when all three are equal to 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, there are no solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, the only possible solutions are either all variables equal or all variables distinct. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but in that case, how do we find the number of solutions? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
We have two cases: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Case 1: All variables equal: a = b = c = 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, only one triple. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Case 2: All variables distinct: a, b, c are all different nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But in this case, since the equation is symmetric, we can model this as a problem where a, b, c are distinct, and then count the number of such triples. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But this might be complicated. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, maybe the only solutions are the all-equal case and the case where two variables are equal but that leads back to the all-equal case. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, so perhaps the only solution is the all-equal case. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But that seems unlikely because the problem is given with 6,000,000, which is a large number, so perhaps the all-equal case is the only one. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but when I tried a=50, it didn't satisfy the equation, so maybe there are no other solutions. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but let's think differently. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Suppose none of the variables are equal. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Then, how can we model this? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, perhaps the only solution is a = b = c = 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But let's verify that. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b when a = b = c = 100: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Each term is 100²*100 = 1,000,000, and there are 6 terms, so 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000, which matches. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But is there any other triple where the sum is 6,000,000? ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, maybe the only triple is (100,100,100), so the number of triples is 1. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But the problem says "the number of triples", and in the beginning, I thought maybe there are more. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but let me think again. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
If we consider the equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But Q = ab + bc + ca. P = abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Given that a + b + c = 300. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
So, in the case where all variables are equal, Q = 3a², P = a³, so 100*3a² - a³ = 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
When a=100, 100*3*(100)^2 - (100)^3= 300,000 - 1,000,000= -700,000, which is not equal to 2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["backtracking"]
Wait, wait, that contradicts. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, no, hold on. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, when a = b = c = 100, then Q = 3*(100)^2=30,000. P=100^3=1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P=100*30,000 -1,000,000= 3,000,000 -1,000,000=2,000,000, which is correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, earlier, I thought that when a = b = c = 100, Q = 3a²=30,000 and P=100*100*100=1,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Thus, 100Q - P= 3,000,000 -1,000,000=2,000,000, which is correct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that works. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But when I tried a=50, it didn't satisfy the equation. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
So, perhaps the only solution is a = b = c=100. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, let's think about another approach. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Suppose we fix a and b, then c=300 -a -b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, plug into the equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b=6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But this seems too complex. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, maybe we can think of the equation as: (a + b)(a + c)(b + c) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, no, that might not be the case. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, no, we have: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc=6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Given that, perhaps we can model this as: 100Q - P=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But we also know that Q and P are related to the roots of the cubic equation. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, maybe we can model it as: Let's think of this as an equation where Q and P are related. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But Q = ab + bc + ca, P=abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But with a + b + c=300. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
So, perhaps we can write Q = (S² - (a² + b² + c²))/2, but I don't know if that helps. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, maybe we can use the inequality constraints. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, each variable is between 0 and 300. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But given that 100Q - P=2,000,000, which is a large number, Q must be significantly large. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, Q=ab + bc + ca, and P=abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which implies that Q=(P + 2,000,000)/100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, Q must be (P + 2,000,000)/100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But Q is also related to the variables. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, since Q=ab + bc + ca, and P=abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, let's think in terms of the variables a, b, c. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Suppose that one of them is much larger than the others. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
For example, suppose c is very large, and a and b are small. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Then, Q≈ab + bc + ca≈ab + c(a + b). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But a + b =300 - c, so Q≈ab + c(300 - c). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, P=abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100Q - P=100[ab + c(300 - c)] - abc=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 100ab + 100c(300 - c) - abc=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But since a and b are small, maybe we can approximate. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But this seems too vague. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But I don't see a direct application. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, another thought: since 100Q - P=2,000,000, and Q=ab + bc + ca, P=abc. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, Q= (P + 2,000,000)/100. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But Q is also equal to (a + b + c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²)/2. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, no, that's not correct. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"]
Wait, actually, (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, ab + bc + ca = [(a + b + c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²)] / 2. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But we don't have information about a² + b² + c². ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for fixed a + b + c=300, the expression ab + bc + ca is maximized when the variables are equal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, abc is maximized when the variables are equal. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so if a, b, c are all equal, then Q is maximized, and P is maximized. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But in our case, 100Q - P is fixed. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, when variables are equal, 100Q - P=2,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
If variables are unequal, Q might be smaller, and P might be smaller or larger? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, if variables are unequal, ab + bc + ca could be smaller or larger, depending on how they're arranged. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But since 100Q - P is fixed, if Q decreases, P might have to decrease or increase accordingly. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But without knowing more, it's hard to say. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But maybe the only way for 100Q - P=2,000,000 is when the variables are equal, because otherwise, Q and P would not satisfy this equation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, perhaps the only solution is when a = b = c = 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, the number of triples is 1. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, the problem is asking for the number of triples of nonnegative integers, so maybe there are more? ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Wait, let me test another case. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Suppose that one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
So, a=200, b=100, c=0. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Check if this satisfies the second equation. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So: 200²*100 + 200²*0 + 100²*200 + 100²*0 + 0²*200 + 0²*100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 40,000*100 + 0 + 10,000*200 + 0 + 0 + 0=4,000,000 + 2,000,000=6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wow, that works. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, (200,100,0) is another solution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, any permutation of this would also satisfy. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, how many permutations are there? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the number of distinct ordered triples is equal to the number of permutations of (200,100,0). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is 3! = 6, but since two elements are distinct and one is zero, the number of distinct ordered triples is 6. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, but 200,100,0 are all different, so yes, 6 permutations. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But wait, is (200,100,0) a solution? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Yes, as we saw, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b=6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, this is another set of solutions. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, any permutation of (200,100,0) would also satisfy. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that's 6 more solutions. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Plus the all-equal solution (100,100,100), so total 7 solutions. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but hold on, is (200,100,0) really a solution? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Yes, as we computed, but also, are there other solutions where two variables are 100, and the third is 100? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, no, that would be (100,100,100). ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, could we have a triple where one variable is 150, another is 150, and the third is 0? ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Let me test that. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, a=150, b=150, c=0. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0²*150 + 0²*150. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, that's 150²*150 + 150²*150=2*(150²*150)=2*(3,375,000)=6,750,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is more than 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
So, that doesn't work. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Alternatively, a=150, b=75, c=75. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
a²b=150²*75=225,000*75=16,875,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
a²c=150²*75=16,875,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
b²a=75²*150=5,625*150=843,750. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
b²c=75²*75=5,625*75=421,875. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
c²a=75²*150=843,750. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
c²b=75²*75=421,875. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Adding all together: 16,875,000 + 16,875,000 +843,750 +421,875 +843,750 +421,875. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 16,875,000 +16,875,000=33,750,000. 843,750 +843,750=1,687,500. 421,875 +421,875=843,750. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, total sum=33,750,000 +1,687,500 +843,750=33,750,000 + 2,531,250=36,281,250. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Which is way larger than 6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
So, that doesn't work. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, so maybe the only solutions are the all-equal case and the permutations of (200,100,0). ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, total solutions: 1 (all equal) + 6 (permutations of 200,100,0)=7. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
But wait, let me test another triple. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
How about (200, 50, 50). ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Wait, we tried that earlier, but it didn't satisfy the equation. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"]
Wait, a=200, b=50, c=50. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
200²*50 + 200²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Compute: 40,000*50 +40,000*50 +2,500*200 +2,500*50 +2,500*200 +2,500*50. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So: 2,000,000 +2,000,000 +500,000 +125,000 +500,000 +125,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Total: 2,000,000 +2,000,000=4,000,000. 500,000 +500,000=1,000,000. 125,000 +125,000=250,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Total sum=4,000,000 +1,000,000 +250,000=5,250,000≠6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that doesn't work. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, (200,50,50) is not a solution. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Wait, but (200,100,0) works because when c=0, a²c=0, and the other terms become a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b= a²b + b²a. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, in the case of (200,100,0), we have 200²*100 +100²*200=40,000*100 +10,000*200=4,000,000 +2,000,000=6,000,000. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that's why it works. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, any permutation where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0 will satisfy. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, how many such triples are there? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Since the three variables are 200, 100, 0, each in different positions. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, for ordered triples, the number is 3! =6. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
But wait, is (200,100,0) different from (100,200,0)? ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Yes, because the problem counts ordered triples, so each permutation is distinct. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, 6 permutations. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, in total, we have: ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
- 1 triple where all are 100. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
- 6 triples where the numbers are 200, 100, 0 in some order. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Therefore, total number of triples is 1 + 6=7. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"]
Wait, but hold on. Let me verify once more. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
When I set a=200, b=100, c=0, that works. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Similarly, any permutation where 200,100,0 are in different positions. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, that's 6 ordered triples. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
Plus the all-equal case, which is 1. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, total 7. ["end-section"]

["deduction"]
So, the answer is 7. ["end-section"]

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}
