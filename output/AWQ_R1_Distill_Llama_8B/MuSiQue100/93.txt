Alright, let's try to figure out this question. The user is asking about a country that is the natural boundary between where a tournament was hosted and where A Don is located, and that country hosted the ASEAN Conference in a specific year. The goal is to find the year the conference was held in that country.

First, I need to understand the key elements: the tournament location, A Don's location, the natural boundary country, and the ASEAN Conference year. It's a bit vague, but I'll try to piece it together.

The ASEAN Conference is likely referring to the ASEAN Summit, which is an annual meeting of the leaders of the ASEAN member states. The user is asking about the year this conference was held in a particular country that acts as a natural boundary between two locations: one hosting a tournament and the other where A Don is located.

I'm not entirely sure who A Don is, but perhaps it's a person or an entity associated with a sports tournament. If A Don is associated with a tournament, maybe the tournament is related to a sport like baseball or another event that A Don is involved in.

Assuming the country is a natural boundary, it's likely a bordering country between the tournament location and A Don's location. For example, if the tournament was in one country and A Don is in another, the natural boundary would be a neighboring country that is hosting the ASEAN Conference.

Now, trying to recall past ASEAN Summits, I know that the Philippines hosted the ASEAN Summit in 2017. The Philippines is an ASEAN member and has hosted the summit before. If the country in question is the Philippines, that would make sense as the natural boundary between two other countries, perhaps where the tournament was held and where A Don is located.

Putting it all together, if the country hosting the ASEAN Conference is the Philippines in 2017, and it's the natural boundary between the tournament location and A Don's location, then the answer would be 2017.
