Alright, let's figure out when William could have gone to the bakery. 

William wakes up at 6am. So, from 6am onward, he's awake.

Next, David saw William waiting at the airport from 8am to 9am. That means William was at the airport during that time.

Then, Michael saw William at school from 9am to 1pm. So, he was in school during those hours.

Sarah saw William at the gym from 1pm to 2pm. So, he was working out then.

Jessica saw him taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 9pm. That's a long time, so he was probably there for a while.

The bakery was closed after 9pm. So, William couldn't have gone to the bakery after 9pm because the bakery was closed.

Now, let's see when William was free. He was at the airport from 8am to 9am. Then at school from 9am to 1pm. At the gym from 1pm to 2pm. And then taking photos from 2pm to 9pm.

So, when was he not occupied? He was busy from 8am to 9pm. That means he didn't have time to go to the bakery because the bakery was closed after 9pm, and he was already occupied until then.

Wait, but the options don't include all the times. Let's check the options again:

(A) 1pm to 2pm
(B) 8am to 9am
(C) 9am to 1pm
(D) 6am to 8am

He was at the airport from 8am to 9am (Option B), at school from 9am to 1pm (Option C), at the gym from 1pm to 2pm (Option A), and taking photos from 2pm to 9pm.

Since the bakery was closed after 9pm and he was occupied the entire time from 8am to 9pm, he couldn't have gone to the bakery during any of those times. Therefore, the correct answer must be that he didn't have time to go to the bakery.

But looking at the options, none of them say "he didn't have time." So, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe he could have gone earlier.

Wait, he was awake at 6am, but was he at the airport from 8am to 9am. So, before that, from 6am to 8am, was he free? But the options don't include 6am to 8am as an option. Option D is 6am to 8am, but that's not one of the times he was at the bakery. The bakery was closed after 9pm, but he was at the airport from 8am to 9am. So, maybe he could have gone earlier.

Wait, but the options are:

(A) 1pm to 2pm
(B) 8am to 9am
(C) 9am to 1pm
(D) 6am to 8am

He was at the airport from 8am to 9am (Option B), at school from 9am to 1pm (Option C), at the gym from 1pm to 2pm (Option A), and taking photos from 2pm to 9pm.

So, the only time he wasn't at those places is from 6am to 8am, but that's not an option for the bakery times. The bakery was closed after 9pm, but he was occupied the entire time until 9pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the bakery because he was busy.

Therefore, the correct answer is that he didn't have time to go to the bakery, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is that he couldn't have gone at all, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the bakery was closed after 9pm, but he could have gone earlier. The earliest he could have gone is 6am, but he was at the airport from 8am to 9am. So, from 6am to 8am, he was free, but the options don't include that time. The options are (A) 1pm to 2pm, (B) 8am to 9am, (C) 9am to 1pm, (D) 6am to 8am.

So, if he was free from 6am to 8am, he could have gone to the bakery during that time. But the options include 6am to 8am as option D, but that's not one of the times he was at the bakery. Wait, no, the question is asking between what times could they have gone. So, the possible times are when he was free. He was free from 6am to 8am, then busy from 8am to 9pm.

Therefore, he could have gone to the bakery between 6am to 8am, which is option D. But the options are:

(A) 1pm to 2pm
(B) 8am to 9am
(C) 9am to 1pm
(D) 6am to 8am

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the bakery was closed after 9pm, but he could have gone earlier. So, the earliest he could have gone is 6am to 8am, which is option D.

But in the timeline, he was at the airport from 8am to 9am, so he was free before that. So, he could have gone to the bakery between 6am to 8am, which is option D.

Therefore, the answer is D.

The correct answer is (D) 6am to 8am.
