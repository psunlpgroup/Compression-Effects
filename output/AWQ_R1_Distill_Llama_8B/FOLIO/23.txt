Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the conclusion that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa is necessarily true, false, or uncertain based on the given premises. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the premises:

1. "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
2. If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
3. If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.
4. Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
5. "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
6. If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.

So, the conclusion is that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa. I need to see if this conclusion follows logically from the premises.

Let me start by listing the premises again for clarity:

- Premise 1: Stranger Things is popular.
- Premise 2: Popular Netflix shows cause Karen to binge-watch.
- Premise 3: Binge-watching a Netflix show by Karen leads to her downloading it.
- Premise 4: Karen does not download Black Mirror.
- Premise 5: Black Mirror is a Netflix show.
- Premise 6: If Karen binge-watches a show, she shares it with Lisa.

Now, the conclusion is that Karen will share Black Mirror with Lisa.

First, I should check if all the premises are necessary for the conclusion or if some can be ignored. Let's see.

From Premise 1, we know that Stranger Things is popular. But since the conclusion is about Black Mirror, not Stranger Things, maybe Premise 1 is just providing context but isn't directly relevant here.

Premise 2 connects popularity of a Netflix show to Karen's action of binge-watching. So, if a show is popular, she watches it. But since Stranger Things is popular, does that mean Karen watches it? Wait, but the conclusion is about Black Mirror, so maybe Premise 2 is setting up the condition for her behavior.

Premise 3: If she binge-watches a show, she downloads it. So, the act of binge-watching leads to downloading. But she doesn't download Black Mirror, as per Premise 4. So, from that, if she doesn't download Black Mirror, that means she didn't binge-watch it, right? Because if she did binge-watch, she would download it.

Wait, but the converse isn't necessarily true. Just because she doesn't download a show doesn't mean she didn't binge-watch it. It could be that she started watching it but didn't finish, or maybe she didn't like it. So, the fact that she doesn't download it doesn't necessarily mean she didn't binge-watch it.

So, Premise 4: She doesn't download Black Mirror. So, from Premise 3, if she binge-watched, she would have downloaded it. So, since she didn't download it, it's possible she didn't binge-watch it. But it's also possible she did binge-watch but for some reason didn't download it, but that's less likely unless there's a specific reason.

Wait, but Premise 3 is an "if and only if" statement. So, it's a bi-conditional. That means that she will download the show if and only if she binge-watches it. So, she can't download the show unless she binge-watches it, and she will download it if she does. So, if she doesn't download it, she didn't binge-watch it. That's a key point.

So, from Premise 4, since she doesn't download Black Mirror, she didn't binge-watch it. Now, from Premise 6, if she binge-watches a show, she shares it with Lisa. So, if she didn't binge-watch Black Mirror, then she wouldn't share it with Lisa.

Wait, but the conclusion is that she will share it with Lisa, so that would be the opposite. So, if she didn't binge-watch it, she wouldn't share it, right? Therefore, the conclusion that she will share it would be false.

But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me outline the steps:

1. "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show (Premise 5).
2. If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it (Premise 2). But we don't know if "Black Mirror" is popular. The only popular show mentioned is Stranger Things (Premise 1), which is a different show. So, we don't know if "Black Mirror" is popular or not. So, Premise 2 might not apply to "Black Mirror" unless we know it's popular.

Wait, that's a good point. The only popular show mentioned is Stranger Things. So, unless "Black Mirror" is also popular, we can't say that Karen will binge-watch it. So, Premise 2 is about if a show is popular, then Karen will binge-watch it. But we don't know if "Black Mirror" is popular. So, maybe she doesn't binge-watch it because it's not popular.

But wait, Premise 1 says Stranger Things is popular, and Premise 2 says that if a show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. So, because Stranger Things is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Then, from Premise 3, if she binge-watches it, she will download it. So, she would have downloaded Stranger Things.

But the issue is with Black Mirror. We know it's a Netflix show (Premise 5), but we don't know if it's popular. So, unless we know it's popular, we can't say she will binge-watch it, which is a prerequisite for downloading or sharing.

Wait, but Premise 6 says that if Karen binge-watches a show, she shares it with Lisa. So, the sharing happens only if she binge-watches it. So, if she doesn't binge-watch it, she won't share it.

But from Premise 4, she doesn't download Black Mirror. And from Premise 3, downloading happens only if she binge-watches. So, she didn't download it because she didn't binge-watch it. Therefore, she won't share it with Lisa.

Wait, but does Premise 6 apply to any show she binge-watches, including Black Mirror if she does? But since she didn't download it, she didn't binge-watch it. So, she won't share it.

But wait, let's think again. The conclusion is that she will share it, but according to the premises, she won't because she didn't download it, so she didn't binge-watch it. Therefore, she won't share it. So, the conclusion is false.

But I'm a bit confused because the premises don't mention whether Black Mirror is popular or not. So, perhaps she didn't binge-watch it because it's not popular, hence she didn't download it, hence she didn't share it.

Alternatively, maybe she did binge-watch it, but she decided not to download it for some reason, but the "if and only if" in Premise 3 makes it that downloading is only possible if she binge-watched, but she didn't download it, so she must not have binge-watched it.

Wait, but the "if and only if" in logic means that both directions are true. So, if she binge-watched, she would have downloaded, and if she downloaded, she must have binge-watched. So, since she didn't download, she didn't binge-watch.

Therefore, since she didn't binge-watch Black Mirror, she won't share it with Lisa. So, the conclusion is that she will share it, which is false.

So, to sum up:

- Black Mirror is a Netflix show (Premise 5).
- If a show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it (Premise 2).
- Since Stranger Things is popular (Premise 1), Karen will binge-watch it (from Premise 2).
- Binge-watching leads to downloading (Premise 3), so she would have downloaded Stranger Things.
- For Black Mirror, we don't know if it's popular, but even if she did binge-watch it, she didn't download it (Premise 4).
- Therefore, since she didn't download it, she didn't binge-watch it.
- Since she didn't binge-watch it, she won't share it with Lisa (Premise 6).
- Therefore, the conclusion that she will share it is false.

So, the conclusion is false.

The conclusion that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa is **false**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 5:** "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
2. **Premise 4:** Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
3. **Premise 3 (Bi-conditional):** If Karen binge-watches a show, she will download it, and if she downloads it, she must have binge-watched it.
   - Since she doesn't download "Black Mirror," she didn't binge-watch it.
4. **Premise 6:** If Karen binge-watches a show, she shares it with Lisa.
   - Because she didn't binge-watch "Black Mirror," she won't share it.

Therefore, the conclusion that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa is false.
