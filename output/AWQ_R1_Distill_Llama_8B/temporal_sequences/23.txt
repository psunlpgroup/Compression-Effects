Alright, let's try to figure out when William could have gone to the art studio. I'll start by listing out all the information given and see how it fits together.

First, William wakes up at 6am. That's his wake-up time. Then, William was seen working out at the gym from 6am to 7am. So, right after waking up, he goes to the gym for an hour.

Next, Sean saw William taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 9am to 12pm. So, that's in the morning, a few hours after he worked out.

Then, Susan saw William working at the office from 12pm to 8pm. So, in the afternoon, he's at the office.

Nancy saw William buying a bike at the bike shop from 8pm to 10pm. That's in the evening after he left the office.

The art studio was closed after 10pm. So, William can't have gone there after 10pm.

Now, let's see when William isn't accounted for. He wakes up at 6am, works out until 7am. Then, from 7am to 9am, we don't have any information. That's a one-hour gap before Sean sees him taking photos.

From 9am to 12pm, Sean saw him taking photos. Then, from 12pm to 8pm, Susan saw him at the office. After that, from 8pm to 10pm, Nancy saw him buying a bike.

The art studio is closed after 10pm, so William couldn't have gone there after that time. But between 7am and 9am, he's not doing anything else. That seems like a window where he could have gone to the art studio.

Wait, but from 7am to 9am, he's not at the gym, not at the office, not taking photos, and not buying a bike. So, he could have gone to the art studio during that time.

Let me check the options. Option D is 7am to 9am, which fits into the gap where he wasn't seen doing anything else.

So, the answer should be option D.

The correct answer is (D) 7am to 9am.

Step-by-step explanation:
- William wakes up at 6am and works out until 7am.
- Between 7am and 9am, there's no information about his activities.
- Sean saw him taking photos from 9am to 12pm.
- Susan saw him at the office from 12pm to 8pm.
- Nancy saw him buying a bike from 8pm to 10pm.
- The art studio is closed after 10pm.
- Therefore, William could have gone to the art studio between 7am and 9am.

Answer: (D) 7am to 9am
