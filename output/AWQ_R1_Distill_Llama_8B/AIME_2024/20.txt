Alright, so I've got this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

First, the problem defines a positive integer \( n \) as \( b \)-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When \( n \) is written in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

For example, it says that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 and 3, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

The task is to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. So, I need to figure out the least base \( b \) where the count of such numbers exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem step by step.

**Understanding the Structure of \( n \) in Base \( b \):**

In any base \( b \), a two-digit number can be represented as \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \), where \( d_1 \) is the digit in the \( b \) place and \( d_0 \) is the digit in the units place. Here, \( d_1 \) can range from 1 to \( b - 1 \) because it can't be zero (otherwise, it would be a single-digit number), and \( d_0 \) can range from 0 to \( b - 1 \).

So, the two-digit number in base \( b \) is \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \).

**Condition for \( b \)-eautiful Number:**

The number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if the sum of its digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \). So, mathematically, this can be written as:
\[ d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \]

But since \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \), substituting that into the equation gives:
\[ d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{d_1 \times b + d_0} \]

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[ (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 \times b + d_0 \]

Expanding the left side:
\[ d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \]

Let's rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:
\[ d_1^2 + 2d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 - d_1 b - d_0 = 0 \]

This looks like a quadratic in terms of \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \). Maybe I can treat this equation as a quadratic equation in \( d_1 \) for each \( d_0 \), or vice versa.

Alternatively, let's consider it as a quadratic equation in \( d_1 \):
\[ d_1^2 + (2d_0 - b)d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \]

Similarly, it's a quadratic in \( d_0 \):
\[ d_0^2 + (2d_1 - 1)d_0 + (d_1^2 - d_1 b) = 0 \]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe it's better to fix \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) within their ranges and see when the equation holds.

**Expressing \( n \) as a Two-Digit Number in Base \( b \):**

Let me denote \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), which is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \). So, \( s = \sqrt{n} \) implies \( n = s^2 \).

But also, \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \). So, we have:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \]
But \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so substituting:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \]
Simplify this:
\[ s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \]
\[ s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \]
So:
\[ d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \]

Interesting. So, \( d_1 \) must be an integer because it's a digit in base \( b \). Therefore, \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer.

Also, \( d_1 \) must satisfy \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \), and \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must satisfy \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b - 1 \).

So, let's write down the constraints:

1. \( s \) must be an integer because \( s = \sqrt{n} \) and \( n \) is a positive integer.
2. \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer.
3. \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \), inclusive.

So, our goal is, for each base \( b \), to count the number of integers \( s \) such that \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) defined as above satisfy the digit constraints.

Alternatively, since \( s \) is the square root of \( n \), \( s \) must be an integer, so \( n \) must be a perfect square.

Therefore, for each base \( b \), the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of perfect squares \( s^2 \) such that:

- \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
- \( d_1 + d_0 = s \)
- \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \)
- \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b - 1 \)

So, perhaps another way to think about this is that \( s^2 \) can be written as a two-digit number in base \( b \), with digits \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), such that their sum is \( s \).

Alternatively, \( s^2 \) must be a two-digit number in base \( b \), so it must satisfy:
\[ b \leq s^2 \leq b^2 - 1 \]
Because the smallest two-digit number in base \( b \) is \( 10_b = b \), and the largest is \( (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \).

So, \( s^2 \) must lie in the interval \( [b, b^2 - 1] \).

Also, since \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), and \( d_1 \geq 1 \), \( d_0 \geq 0 \), so \( s \geq 1 + 0 = 1 \). But since \( s^2 \geq b \), and \( b \geq 2 \), \( s \geq \sqrt{b} \). So, \( s \) is at least 2 when \( b \geq 4 \), but for \( b = 2 \), \( s \geq \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), so \( s \geq 2 \).

Wait, actually, \( s \) must be integer because \( s = \sqrt{n} \), so \( s \) must be an integer greater than or equal to 2 (since \( n \geq 1 \), but for \( n \geq b \), which is at least 2, \( s \geq 2 \)).

So, for each base \( b \), we can consider \( s \) starting from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) up to \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \), which is just less than \( b \). So, \( s \) ranges from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

But perhaps more precise: \( s \) is such that \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( s^2 \geq b \) and \( s^2 < b^2 \). Therefore, \( s \) must satisfy \( \sqrt{b} \leq s < b \). Since \( s \) is an integer, \( s \) can be from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

So, for each \( b \), the possible values of \( s \) are integers from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \). For each such \( s \), we can compute \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), and check whether \( d_1 \) is an integer and whether \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

So, to count the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers, we need to count the number of integers \( s \) in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \) such that \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are valid digits in base \( b \).

Therefore, for each \( b \), we can iterate through each \( s \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \), compute \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \), check if they are valid, and count how many such \( s \) satisfy the conditions.

Our goal is to find the smallest \( b \) such that this count exceeds 10.

So, perhaps we can approach this problem by incrementally testing bases starting from \( b = 2 \) upwards, computing the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers for each \( b \), and stopping when we find the first \( b \) where the count is greater than 10.

But before diving into code or extensive calculations, maybe there's a pattern or a formula we can derive.

**Expressing \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) in Terms of \( s \) and \( b \):**

From earlier, we have:
\[ d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \]
\[ d_0 = s - d_1 = s - \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} = \frac{(s)(b - 1) - (s^2 - s)}{b - 1} = \frac{s b - s - s^2 + s}{b - 1} = \frac{s b - s^2}{b - 1} \]

So, both \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) must be integers. Therefore, \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) must be integers, which imposes conditions on \( s \) and \( b \).

So, \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) must be an integer, and \( \frac{s b - s^2}{b - 1} \) must also be an integer.

Wait, perhaps if I write \( d_1 = \frac{s(s - 1)}{b - 1} \), so \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

But since \( b - 1 \) and \( s \) may not necessarily be coprime, this might not hold. Alternatively, because \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must be a divisor of either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but not necessarily both.

Wait, perhaps that's too restrictive. Maybe a better approach is to note that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \), so \( b - 1 \) must divide the product \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but not necessarily both.

But perhaps I can think of \( b - 1 \) as a factor of \( s(s - 1) \). So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).

Given that, for each \( s \), \( b - 1 \) must be a divisor of \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) is between \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and \( b - 1 \), perhaps \( b - 1 \) is a divisor of \( s(s - 1) \), but since \( s \) is less than \( b \), \( s \) and \( b - 1 \) might share a common divisor.

Alternatively, maybe we can rephrase the equation:

From \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), since \( d_1 \) must be an integer, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s^2 - s \).

Similarly, \( d_0 = \frac{sb - s^2}{b - 1} \) must also be an integer, so \( b - 1 \) divides \( sb - s^2 \).

But \( sb - s^2 = s(b - s) \), so \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(b - s) \).

So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(b - s) \).

Given that \( s \) is between \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and \( b - 1 \), \( b - s \) is between 1 and \( \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor \).

Hmm, this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to consider specific values of \( b \) and compute the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers.

But considering the problem asks for the least \( b \) with more than ten such numbers, we might need to go through several bases.

But perhaps we can find a pattern or a formula to compute the number of solutions for each \( b \).

Let me consider the equation again:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Expanding:

\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Rearranged:

\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

This is a quadratic in \( d_1 \). For \( d_1 \) to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

The discriminant \( D \) of this quadratic is:

\( D = (2 d_0 - b)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (d_0^2 - d_0) \)
\( D = 4 d_0^2 - 4 b d_0 + b^2 - 4 d_0^2 + 4 d_0 \)
Simplify:
\( D = -4 b d_0 + b^2 + 4 d_0 \)
\( D = b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) \)

For \( d_1 \) to be an integer, \( D \) must be a perfect square. Let \( D = k^2 \), where \( k \) is a positive integer.

So, \( b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) = k^2 \)

But this seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can fix \( d_0 \) and express \( d_1 \) in terms of \( d_0 \) and \( b \).

From \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), so:

\( s = d_1 + d_0 \)
\( s^2 = d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 \)
But \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

So, equate:
\( d_1 b + d_0 = d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 \)
Rearrange:
\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

Which is the same quadratic as before.

Wait, perhaps instead of fixing \( s \), I can fix \( d_0 \) and then solve for \( d_1 \).

Given \( d_0 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \), inclusive, and \( d_1 \) is between 1 and \( b - 1 \), inclusive.

So, for each \( d_0 \) from 0 to \( b - 1 \), solve for \( d_1 \) such that:

\( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), where \( s = d_1 + d_0 \)

But \( s \) is a function of \( d_1 \), so it's a bit circular.

Alternatively, express \( s \) in terms of \( d_0 \):

From \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), substitute into \( n = s^2 \):

\( n = (d_1 + d_0)^2 \)
But also, \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Therefore:
\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Expanding:
\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Rearranged:
\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

So, this is a quadratic in \( d_1 \). For each \( d_0 \), we can solve for \( d_1 \).

The quadratic equation is:
\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

Let me compute the discriminant \( D \) for each \( d_0 \):
\( D = (2 d_0 - b)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (d_0^2 - d_0) \)
\( D = 4 d_0^2 - 4 b d_0 + b^2 - 4 d_0^2 + 4 d_0 \)
Simplify:
\( D = -4 b d_0 + b^2 + 4 d_0 \)
\( D = b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) \)

For \( d_1 \) to be an integer, \( D \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote \( D = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer.

So, for each \( d_0 \), \( b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) \) must be a perfect square.

But this seems complicated because \( d_0 \) varies from 0 to \( b - 1 \). Maybe instead of going this route, think about the equation \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \) and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

Let me write \( s = d_1 + d_0 \) and substitute into \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \):

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Expanding:
\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)
Rearranged:
\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + d_0^2 - d_0 = 0 \)

Which is the quadratic equation in \( d_1 \) as before.

Alternatively, express this as:

\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

Let me denote this as quadratic in \( d_1 \). The discriminant is \( D = (2 d_0 - b)^2 - 4(d_0^2 - d_0) \).

Simplify \( D \):

\( D = 4 d_0^2 - 4 b d_0 + b^2 - 4 d_0^2 + 4 d_0 \)
Simplify term by term:
- \( 4 d_0^2 - 4 d_0^2 = 0 \)
- \( -4 b d_0 + 4 d_0 = 4 d_0 (1 - b) \)
- \( + b^2 \)
So, \( D = b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) \)

So, for each \( d_0 \), compute \( D = b^2 - 4 d_0 (b - 1) \). If \( D \) is a perfect square, then \( d_1 \) is an integer, and we can compute it.

Thus, for each \( d_0 \), we can compute \( D \), check if it's a perfect square, and if so, compute \( d_1 \) and check if it's within the valid range.

But this seems computationally intensive. Maybe we can find a smarter way.

**Alternative Approach: Expressing \( b \) in Terms of \( s \) and \( d_0 \)**

From \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \) and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), we can solve for \( b \):

Express \( d_1 = s - d_0 \), then substitute into the first equation:

\( s^2 = (s - d_0) b + d_0 \)
\( s^2 = s b - d_0 b + d_0 \)
Bring terms with \( b \) to one side:

\( s^2 - s = -d_0 b + d_0 \)
Factor out \( d_0 \):

\( s(s - 1) = d_0 (-b + 1) \)
Multiply both sides by -1:

\( s(1 - s) = d_0 (b - 1) \)
So:

\( d_0 = \frac{s(1 - s)}{b - 1} \)

But \( d_0 \) must be a non-negative integer less than or equal to \( b - 1 \). Therefore, \( d_0 = \frac{s(1 - s)}{b - 1} \) must be an integer between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

Note that \( s \) is at least \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and less than \( b \).

So, \( s \) is between 2 and \( b - 1 \) for \( b \geq 3 \). For \( b = 2 \), \( s \) is between 2 and 1, which isn't possible, so \( b = 2 \) might not have any \( b \)-eautiful numbers.

Wait, for \( b = 2 \), the two-digit numbers are from 2 to 3 (binary 10 and 11). Let's check if any of them satisfy \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \).

For \( n = 2 \) (10 in binary), \( d_1 = 1 \), \( d_0 = 0 \). Sum is 1, \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \), not integer.

For \( n = 3 \) (11 in binary), \( d_1 = 1 \), \( d_0 = 1 \). Sum is 2, \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), not integer.

So, no \( b = 2 \)-eautiful numbers.

Similarly, for \( b = 3 \), the two-digit numbers range from 3 to 8 (10 to 22 in base 3). Let's check each:

- 10: 1+0=1, sqrt(3)≈1.732
- 11: 1+1=2, sqrt(3)≈1.732
- 12: 1+2=3, sqrt(4)=2
- 20: 2+0=2, sqrt(6)≈2.449
- 21: 2+1=3, sqrt(7)≈2.645
- 22: 2+2=4, sqrt(8)≈2.828

None of these sums equal the square roots, so no \( b = 3 \)-eautiful numbers.

Moving on to \( b = 4 \):

Two-digit numbers in base 4: 4 to 15 (10 to 33 in base 4).

Let's list them:

- 10: 1+0=1, sqrt(4)=2
- 11: 1+1=2, sqrt(5)≈2.236
- 12: 1+2=3, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 13: 1+3=4, sqrt(9)=3
- 20: 2+0=2, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 21: 2+1=3, sqrt(9)=3
- 22: 2+2=4, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 23: 2+3=5, sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 30: 3+0=3, sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 31: 3+1=4, sqrt(13)≈3.606
- 32: 3+2=5, sqrt(16)=4
- 33: 3+3=6, sqrt(16)=4

So, checking each:

- 13: 1+3=4, sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.
- 21: 2+1=3, sqrt(9)=3. Equal! So, 21 is 4-eautiful.
- 32: 3+2=5, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.
- 33: 3+3=6, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 21 is 2+1=3, and sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583, which is not 3. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, \( n = 21 \) in base 4 is 2*4 + 1 = 9, right? So \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \), which is equal to 2 + 1 = 3. So, yes, 21 is 4-eautiful.

Similarly, 32 in base 4 is 3*4 + 2 = 14. \( \sqrt{14} \approx 3.741 \), which is not equal to 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, no, 3 + 2 = 5, sqrt(14) ≈ 3.741. Not equal.

Wait, 32 in base 4 is 14 in decimal. So, \( \sqrt{14} \) is not 5.

Wait, but 32 in base 4 is 3*4 + 2 = 14, so \( \sqrt{14} \approx 3.7417 \), which is not equal to 5.

So, actually, only 21 is 4-eautiful.

Wait, let's check all:

- 10: 1, sqrt(4)=2. Not equal.
- 11: 2, sqrt(5). Not equal.
- 12: 3, sqrt(8). Not equal.
- 13: 4, sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.
- 20: 2, sqrt(8). Not equal.
- 21: 3, sqrt(9)=3. Equal.
- 22: 4, sqrt(8). Not equal.
- 23: 5, sqrt(12). Not equal.
- 30: 3, sqrt(12). Not equal.
- 31: 4, sqrt(13). Not equal.
- 32: 5, sqrt(14). Not equal.
- 33: 6, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

So, only one number: 21 is 4-eautiful. So, count is 1.

Moving on to \( b = 5 \):

Two-digit numbers in base 5: 5 to 24 (10 to 44 in base 5).

List them:

- 10: 1+0=1, sqrt(5)≈2.236
- 11: 1+1=2, sqrt(6)≈2.449
- 12: 1+2=3, sqrt(7)≈2.645
- 13: 1+3=4, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 14: 1+4=5, sqrt(9)=3
- 15: 1+5=6, sqrt(9)=3 (Wait, 15 in base 5 is 1*5 + 5? Wait, no, in base 5, digits can't exceed 4. So, actually, 15 in base 5 is invalid. The maximum is 44 in base 5, which is 4*5 + 4 = 24.

Wait, so 44 is 24 in decimal. So, let's correct that.

So, n ranges from 5 to 24.

Wait, 10 in base 5 is 5, 11 is 6, 12 is 7, ..., 44 is 24.

So, let's list each n and check:

- 10: 1+0=1, sqrt(5)≈2.236
- 11: 1+1=2, sqrt(6)≈2.449
- 12: 1+2=3, sqrt(7)≈2.645
- 13: 1+3=4, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 14: 1+4=5, sqrt(9)=3
- 20: 2+0=2, sqrt(10)≈3.162
- 21: 2+1=3, sqrt(11)≈3.316
- 22: 2+2=4, sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 23: 2+3=5, sqrt(13)≈3.606
- 24: 2+4=6, sqrt(14)≈3.741
- 30: 3+0=3, sqrt(15)≈3.872
- 31: 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4
- 32: 3+2=5, sqrt(17)≈4.123
- 33: 3+3=6, sqrt(18)≈4.242
- 34: 3+4=7, sqrt(19)≈4.358
- 40: 4+0=4, sqrt(20)≈4.472
- 41: 4+1=5, sqrt(21)≈4.583
- 42: 4+2=6, sqrt(22)≈4.690
- 43: 4+3=7, sqrt(23)≈4.796
- 44: 4+4=8, sqrt(24)≈4.899

Now, let's check where the sum of digits equals the square root of n.

Looking through:

- 14: 1+4=5, sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.
- 31: 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4. Equal! So, 31 is 5-eautiful.
- 41: 4+1=5, sqrt(21)≈4.583. Not equal.
- 42: 4+2=6, sqrt(22)≈4.690. Not equal.
- 43: 4+3=7, sqrt(23)≈4.796. Not equal.
- 44: 4+4=8, sqrt(24)≈4.899. Not equal.

So, only 31 is 5-eautiful. Count is 1.

Hmm, so far, for bases 2 through 5, the count is 0, 0, 1, 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier with \( b = 4 \). Let me recheck.

For \( b = 4 \), two-digit numbers are 4 to 15 (in decimal). In base 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33.

Wait, n=10: 1+0=1 vs sqrt(4)=2. No.
n=11: 1+1=2 vs sqrt(5)=2.236. No.
n=12: 1+2=3 vs sqrt(8)=2.828. No.
n=13: 1+3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.
n=20: 2+0=2 vs sqrt(8)=2.828. No.
n=21: 2+1=3 vs sqrt(9)=3. Yes.
n=22: 2+2=4 vs sqrt(8)=2.828. No.
n=23: 2+3=5 vs sqrt(12)=3.464. No.
n=30: 3+0=3 vs sqrt(12)=3.464. No.
n=31: 3+1=4 vs sqrt(13)=3.606. No.
n=32: 3+2=5 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.
n=33: 3+3=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.

So, only n=21 is 4-eautiful. So, count is 1.

Similarly, for \( b = 5 \), only n=31 is 5-eautiful.

Wait, maybe I need to check higher bases.

Let me try \( b = 6 \):

Two-digit numbers in base 6: 6 to 35 (10 to 23 in base 6).

Compute each n:

- 10: 1+0=1, sqrt(6)≈2.449
- 11: 1+1=2, sqrt(7)≈2.645
- 12: 1+2=3, sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 13: 1+3=4, sqrt(9)=3
- 14: 1+4=5, sqrt(10)≈3.162
- 15: 1+5=6, sqrt(11)≈3.316
- 16: 1+6=7, sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 20: 2+0=2, sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 21: 2+1=3, sqrt(13)≈3.606
- 22: 2+2=4, sqrt(14)≈3.741
- 23: 2+3=5, sqrt(15)≈3.872
- 24: 2+4=6, sqrt(16)=4
- 25: 2+5=7, sqrt(17)≈4.123
- 26: 2+6=8, sqrt(18)≈4.242
- 30: 3+0=3, sqrt(18)≈4.242
- 31: 3+1=4, sqrt(19)≈4.358
- 32: 3+2=5, sqrt(20)≈4.472
- 33: 3+3=6, sqrt(21)≈4.583
- 34: 3+4=7, sqrt(22)≈4.690
- 35: 3+5=8, sqrt(24)≈4.899

Now, check where sum of digits equals sqrt(n):

- 13: 1+3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.
- 24: 2+4=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.
- 32: 3+2=5 vs sqrt(20)≈4.472. No.
- 33: 3+3=6 vs sqrt(21)≈4.583. No.
- 34: 3+4=7 vs sqrt(22)≈4.690. No.
- 35: 3+5=8 vs sqrt(24)≈4.899. No.

Wait, is there any other?

Wait, 16 in base 6 is 1*6 + 6, which is 12 in decimal. Wait, 16 in base 6 is actually invalid because in base 6, the digit 6 is not allowed; digits go up to 5. So, 16 in base 6 is actually 2*6 + 4 = 16 in decimal. Wait, no, 16 in base 6 is 1*6 + 6, but 6 is not a valid digit. So, actually, 16 in base 6 is invalid. So, the maximum two-digit number in base 6 is 35 in base 6, which is 3*6 + 5 = 23 in decimal.

Wait, so in decimal, the numbers are from 6 to 23.

Wait, so 10 in base 6 is 6 in decimal, 11 is 7, ..., 23 is 23.

So, let's check:

- 10: 1+0=1 vs sqrt(6)≈2.449
- 11: 1+1=2 vs sqrt(7)≈2.645
- 12: 1+2=3 vs sqrt(8)≈2.828
- 13: 1+3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3
- 14: 1+4=5 vs sqrt(10)≈3.162
- 15: 1+5=6 vs sqrt(11)≈3.316
- 20: 2+0=2 vs sqrt(12)≈3.464
- 21: 2+1=3 vs sqrt(13)≈3.606
- 22: 2+2=4 vs sqrt(14)≈3.741
- 23: 2+3=5 vs sqrt(15)≈3.872
- 24: 2+4=6 vs sqrt(16)=4
- 25: 2+5=7 vs sqrt(17)≈4.123
- 26: 2+6=8 vs sqrt(18)≈4.242
- 30: 3+0=3 vs sqrt(18)≈4.242
- 31: 3+1=4 vs sqrt(19)≈4.358
- 32: 3+2=5 vs sqrt(20)≈4.472
- 33: 3+3=6 vs sqrt(21)≈4.583
- 34: 3+4=7 vs sqrt(22)≈4.690
- 35: 3+5=8 vs sqrt(23)≈4.796

Wait, none of these sums equal the square roots. So, is there no 6-eautiful numbers? Hmm.

Wait, but n=24 in decimal is 2*6 + 4 = 16. sqrt(16)=4, but 2 + 4=6. Not equal.

n=25 in decimal is 2*6 + 5=17. sqrt(17)≈4.123, which is not 7.

Wait, n=13 in decimal is 1*6 + 3=9. sqrt(9)=3, and 1+3=4. Not equal.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute n=9 in decimal: it's 13 in base 6. So, digits 1 and 3. 1 + 3 = 4, sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.

Wait, so perhaps there are no 6-eautiful numbers. So, count is 0.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, maybe n=16 is in base 6, but as mentioned, 16 in base 6 is invalid because 6 is not a digit. So, 16 in base 6 would actually be 2*6 + 4=16, which is 24 in base 6.

Wait, no, 24 in base 6 is 2*6 + 4=16, which is 16 in decimal. So, n=16 is 24 in base 6, with digits 2 and 4. 2 + 4=6, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

Wait, maybe I need to check for n=25 in base 6: 25 decimal is 4*6 + 1=25, which is 41 in base 6. So, 4 + 1=5, sqrt(25)=5. Equal! So, 41 in base 6 is 25 in decimal, and 4 + 1=5= sqrt(25). So, 25 is 6-eautiful.

Wait, so I missed that.

Similarly, 25 in base 6 is 41, sum is 5, sqrt(25)=5.

Similarly, n=25: 25 in decimal is 41 in base 6, which is 4 and 1, sum 5, sqrt(25)=5. So, 25 is 6-eautiful.

Similarly, n=16 is 24 in base 6, sum is 6, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

Wait, n=25: 25 is 41 in base 6, which is 4 + 1=5, sqrt(25)=5. So, 25 is 6-eautiful.

Similarly, n=26: 26 in decimal is 42 in base 6. 4 + 2=6, sqrt(26)≈5.099. Not equal.

n=36: 100 in base 6, which is three digits, so beyond two digits.

Wait, let me check n=25 and n=26:

n=25: 4 + 1=5, sqrt(25)=5. Yes.

n=26: 4 + 2=6, sqrt(26)≈5.099. No.

n=27: 43 in base 6, 4 + 3=7, sqrt(27)≈5.196. No.

n=28: 44 in base 6, 4 + 4=8, sqrt(28)≈5.291. No.

n=29: 45 in base 6, 4 + 5=9, sqrt(29)≈5.385. No.

n=30: 50 in base 6, 5 + 0=5, sqrt(30)≈5.477. No.

Wait, 50 in base 6 is 5*6 + 0=30. So, 5 + 0=5, sqrt(30)≈5.477. Not equal.

Wait, n=25 is the only one?

Wait, let me check n=16: 24 in base 6, 2 + 4=6, sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

Wait, n=9: 13 in base 6, 1 + 3=4, sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.

Wait, n=16: 24 in base 6, sum=6, sqrt(16)=4. No.

Wait, n=25: 41 in base 6, sum=5, sqrt(25)=5. Yes.

n=35: 35 in decimal is 55 in base 6, 5 + 5=10, sqrt(35)≈5.916. No.

n=36: 100 in base 6, three digits. So, beyond two digits.

Wait, n=25 is 41 in base 6, and that's a two-digit number. So, is 25 the only 6-eautiful number?

Wait, n=25 is 41 in base 6, which is 4 + 1=5, sqrt(25)=5. So, that works.

Wait, n=9 is 13 in base 6: 1 + 3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.

n=16 is 24 in base 6: 2 + 4=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

n=25: 41 in base 6: 4 + 1=5 vs sqrt(25)=5. Equal.

n=36 is 100 in base 6: three digits, so beyond two digits.

Wait, so only 25 is 6-eautiful. So, count is 1.

Wait, but 25 is only one number. So, count is 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to check higher bases.

Wait, maybe b=7.

Two-digit numbers in base 7: 7 to 48 (10 to 33 in base 7).

Compute each n:

n=7: 10 in base 7: 1+0=1 vs sqrt(7)≈2.645
n=8: 11 in base 7: 1+1=2 vs sqrt(8)≈2.828
n=9: 12 in base 7: 1+2=3 vs sqrt(9)=3. Equal! So, 12 in base 7 is 9 in decimal, which is 3^2. So, 1 + 2=3= sqrt(9). So, 9 is 7-eautiful.
n=10: 13 in base 7: 1+3=4 vs sqrt(10)≈3.162
n=11: 14 in base 7: 1+4=5 vs sqrt(11)≈3.316
n=12: 15 in base 7: 1+5=6 vs sqrt(12)≈3.464
n=13: 16 in base 7: 1+6=7 vs sqrt(13)≈3.606
n=14: 20 in base 7: 2+0=2 vs sqrt(14)≈3.741
n=15: 21 in base 7: 2+1=3 vs sqrt(15)≈3.872
n=16: 22 in base 7: 2+2=4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Equal! So, 22 in base 7 is 16 in decimal, and 2 + 2=4= sqrt(16). So, 16 is 7-eautiful.
n=17: 23 in base 7: 2+3=5 vs sqrt(17)≈4.123
n=18: 24 in base 7: 2+4=6 vs sqrt(18)≈4.242
n=19: 25 in base 7: 2+5=7 vs sqrt(19)≈4.358
n=20: 30 in base 7: 3+0=3 vs sqrt(20)≈4.472
n=21: 31 in base 7: 3+1=4 vs sqrt(21)≈4.583
n=22: 32 in base 7: 3+2=5 vs sqrt(22)≈4.690
n=23: 33 in base 7: 3+3=6 vs sqrt(23)≈4.796
n=24: 34 in base 7: 3+4=7 vs sqrt(24)≈4.899
n=25: 40 in base 7: 4+0=4 vs sqrt(25)=5
n=26: 41 in base 7: 4+1=5 vs sqrt(26)≈5.099
n=27: 42 in base 7: 4+2=6 vs sqrt(27)≈5.196
n=28: 43 in base 7: 4+3=7 vs sqrt(28)≈5.291
n=29: 44 in base 7: 4+4=8 vs sqrt(29)≈5.385
n=30: 50 in base 7: 5+0=5 vs sqrt(30)≈5.477
n=31: 51 in base 7: 5+1=6 vs sqrt(31)≈5.568
n=32: 52 in base 7: 5+2=7 vs sqrt(32)≈5.657
n=33: 53 in base 7: 5+3=8 vs sqrt(33)≈5.744
n=34: 60 in base 7: 6+0=6 vs sqrt(34)≈5.830
n=35: 61 in base 7: 6+1=7 vs sqrt(35)≈5.916
n=36: 62 in base 7: 6+2=8 vs sqrt(36)=6
n=37: 63 in base 7: 6+3=9 vs sqrt(37)≈6.082
n=38: 64 in base 7: 6+4=10 vs sqrt(38)≈6.164
n=39: 65 in base 7: 6+5=11 vs sqrt(39)≈6.245
n=40: 70 in base 7: 7+0=7 vs sqrt(40)≈6.324
n=41: 71 in base 7: 7+1=8 vs sqrt(41)≈6.403
n=42: 72 in base 7: 7+2=9 vs sqrt(42)≈6.480
n=43: 73 in base 7: 7+3=10 vs sqrt(43)≈6.557

n=46: 80 in base 7: 8+0=8 vs sqrt(46)≈6.782
n=47: 81 in base 7: 8+1=9 vs sqrt(47)≈6.855
n=48: 82 in base 7: 8+2=10 vs sqrt(48)≈6.928

Now, let's check which of these satisfy \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \):

Looking through:

- n=9: 1 + 2=3 vs sqrt(9)=3. Equal. So, 9 is 7-eautiful.
- n=16: 2 + 2=4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Equal. So, 16 is 7-eautiful.
- n=25: 4 + 0=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.
- n=36: 6 + 0=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Equal. So, 36 is 7-eautiful.
- n=49: 100 in base 7, which is three digits, so beyond two digits.

Wait, let me double-check:

- n=9: 12 in base 7, 1 + 2=3, sqrt(9)=3. Yes.
- n=16: 22 in base 7, 2 + 2=4, sqrt(16)=4. Yes.
- n=36: 60 in base 7, 6 + 0=6, sqrt(36)=6. Yes.

Wait, any others?

n=25: 40 in base 7, 4 + 0=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.

n=36: 60 in base 7, 6 + 0=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Yes.

n=49: 100 in base 7, three digits.

So, total 7-eautiful numbers: 9, 16, 36. So, count is 3.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check n=25 and others.

Wait, n=25 is 40 in base 7: 4 + 0=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.

n=36 is 60 in base 7: 6 + 0=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Equal.

Wait, n=49 is 100 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=64: 110 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=25: 40 in base 7, which is 4*7 + 0=28. sqrt(28)≈5.291. Not equal to 4.

Wait, but 28 is 40 in base 7, so 4 + 0=4 vs sqrt(28)≈5.291. Not equal.

Wait, n=36: 60 in base 7 is 6*7 + 0=42. sqrt(42)≈6.480. But 6 + 0=6 vs sqrt(42)≈6.480. Not equal.

Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 60 in base 7 is 6*7 + 0=42 in decimal. So, sqrt(42)≈6.480, which is not equal to 6.

Wait, so n=36 is 60 in base 7, which is 42 in decimal, so sqrt(42)≈6.480. But the sum of digits is 6 + 0=6. So, not equal.

Wait, so maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let's recast.

n=9: 12 in base 7: 1 + 2=3, sqrt(9)=3. Equal.

n=16: 22 in base 7: 2 + 2=4, sqrt(16)=4. Equal.

n=25: 40 in base 7: 4 + 0=4, sqrt(25)=5. Not equal.

n=36: 60 in base 7: 6 + 0=6, sqrt(36)=6. Equal.

Wait, sqrt(36)=6, which is equal to the sum of digits 6 + 0=6.

So, n=36 is 7-eautiful.

Wait, n=49: 100 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=36 is 60 in base 7, which is 42 in decimal, and sqrt(42)≈6.480. But the sum of digits is 6 + 0=6. So, 6 ≠ 6.480. So, n=36 is 42 in decimal, whose square root is ≈6.480, but the sum of digits is 6. So, not equal.

Wait, hold on. There's confusion here between the number in decimal and the number in base 7.

Wait, the problem says n is a positive integer. So, n is in decimal. The sum of its digits when written in base b must equal sqrt(n).

So, n is in decimal. So, n is written in base b, and the digits sum to sqrt(n).

So, for example, n=9 is written as 12 in base 7, so digits 1 and 2 sum to 3, and sqrt(9)=3. So, equal.

n=16 is written as 22 in base 7, so digits 2 and 2 sum to 4, and sqrt(16)=4. Equal.

n=36 is written as 60 in base 7, so digits 6 and 0 sum to 6, and sqrt(36)=6. Equal.

Wait, but n=36 is 36 in decimal, written as 60 in base 7, so digits sum to 6, sqrt(36)=6. So, equal.

Wait, n=36 is 60 in base 7, so digits 6 and 0, sum 6, sqrt(36)=6.

Wait, but 60 in base 7 is 6*7 + 0=42 in decimal, but n is 42, which is different from 36.

Wait, hold on, this is a crucial point.

Wait, the problem says n is a positive integer. So, n is in decimal. Then, n is written in base b as a two-digit number, whose digits sum to sqrt(n).

So, n is in decimal, but when written in base b, it's a two-digit number. So, n must satisfy \( b \leq n \leq b^2 - 1 \).

But also, n must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) must be integer.

Wait, so n is a perfect square, and when written in base b, it's a two-digit number whose digits sum to sqrt(n).

So, for example, n=9 is 3^2, written as 12 in base 7, digits sum to 3, which is sqrt(9). So, 9 is 7-eautiful.

Similarly, n=16 is 4^2, written as 22 in base 7, digits sum to 4, which is sqrt(16). So, 16 is 7-eautiful.

n=25 is 5^2, written as 40 in base 7, digits sum to 4, which is not equal to 5. So, 25 is not 7-eautiful.

n=36 is 6^2, written as 60 in base 7, digits sum to 6, which is sqrt(36). So, 36 is 7-eautiful.

n=49 is 7^2, written as 100 in base 7, which is three digits. So, not two-digit. So, not 7-eautiful.

Wait, so n=9, 16, 36 are 7-eautiful. So, count is 3.

Wait, so only three numbers. So, count is 3.

Wait, so perhaps b=7 has 3 b-eautiful numbers.

Wait, let me check higher bases.

Wait, n=49 is 100 in base 7: three digits.

n=64 is 110 in base 7: three digits.

n=81 is 121 in base 7: three digits.

n=100 is 215 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=49: 100 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=64: 110 in base 7: three digits.

Wait, n=25: 40 in base 7: two digits, but sum=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal.

n=36: 60 in base 7: two digits, sum=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Equal.

n=49: three digits.

Wait, so only 9, 16, and 36 are 7-eautiful. So, count is 3.

Wait, let's move to b=8.

Two-digit numbers in base 8: 8 to 63 (10 to 77 in base 8).

Check each n which is a perfect square between 8 and 63:

n=9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64.

But 64 in base 8 is 100, which is three digits, so beyond two digits.

So, n=9, 16, 25, 36, 49.

Now, write each in base 8 and check:

n=9: 11 in base 8: 1 + 1=2 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.
n=16: 20 in base 8: 2 + 0=2 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.
n=25: 31 in base 8: 3 + 1=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.
n=36: 44 in base 8: 4 + 4=8 vs sqrt(36)=6. No.
n=49: 61 in base 8: 6 + 1=7 vs sqrt(49)=7. Equal! So, 61 in base 8 is 6*8 + 1=49. 6 + 1=7, sqrt(49)=7. So, 49 is 8-eautiful.

Wait, is there another?

n=64: 100 in base 8: three digits. So, no.

Wait, n=49 is 61 in base 8: 6 + 1=7, sqrt(49)=7. Equal.

Wait, any others?

n=25: 31 in base 8: 3 + 1=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.

n=36: 44 in base 8: 4 + 4=8 vs sqrt(36)=6. No.

n=16: 20 in base 8: 2 + 0=2 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.

n=9: 11 in base 8: 1 + 1=2 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.

Wait, n=64 is 100 in base 8: three digits.

Wait, n=81 is 121 in base 8: three digits.

Wait, n=100 is 214 in base 8: three digits.

Wait, n=49 is the only one.

Wait, so 49 is 61 in base 8: 6 + 1=7, sqrt(49)=7. So, only one number.

Wait, is there another?

Wait, n=16 is 20 in base 8: 2 + 0=2 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.

n=25 is 31 in base 8: 3 + 1=4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.

n=36 is 44 in base 8: 4 + 4=8 vs sqrt(36)=6. No.

n=49 is 61 in base 8: 6 + 1=7 vs sqrt(49)=7. Yes.

n=64 is 100 in base 8: three digits.

So, only one number: 49 is 8-eautiful.

Wait, count is 1.

Moving on to \( b = 9 \):

Two-digit numbers in base 9: 9 to 80 (10 to 88 in base 9).

Check perfect squares in this range:

n=9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.

Now, write each in base 9 and check:

n=9: 10 in base 9: 1 + 0=1 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.
n=16: 17 in base 9: 1 + 7=8 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.
n=25: 26 in base 9: 2 + 6=8 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.
n=36: 35 in base 9: 3 + 5=8 vs sqrt(36)=6. No.
n=49: 55 in base 9: 5 + 5=10 vs sqrt(49)=7. No.
n=64: 74 in base 9: 7 + 4=11 vs sqrt(64)=8. No.

Moving on to \( b = 10 \):

Two-digit numbers in base 10: 10 to 99.

Perfect squares in this range: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 (but 100 is three digits, so exclude).

So, n=16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.

So, n=16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121.

But n=121 is 10A in base 11: three digits.

So, n=16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

Now, write each in base 11:

n=16: 16 in base 10 is 15 in base 11 (1*11 + 5). 1 + 5=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.
n=25: 25 in base 10 is 23 in base 11 (2*11 + 3). 2 + 3=5 vs sqrt(25)=5. Equal! So, 25 is 11-eautiful.

n=196: 196 in base 10 is CE in base 19 (12*19 + 14). 12 + 14=26 vs sqrt(196)=14. No.
n=225: 225 in base 10 is CF in base 19 (12*19 + 15). 12 + 15=27 vs sqrt(225)=15. No.
n=256: 256 in base 10 is 128 in base 19: three digits.
n=289: 289 in base 10 is 151 in base 19: three digits.
n=324: 324 in base 10 is 168 in base 19: three digits.

So, no 19-eautiful numbers.

Wait, count is 0.

Wait, seems like the count is not increasing as we go higher.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, so far, up to b=19, the maximum count is 3 for b=7, 12, 16.

Wait, let me try b=24.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach.

Wait, let me recall that for a number n to be b-eautiful, n must be a two-digit number in base b, so \( b \leq n \leq b^2 - 1 \), and \( \sqrt{n} = d_1 + d_0 \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are digits in base b.

So, \( d_1 + d_0 = \sqrt{n} \)
And \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \)

So, we can write:

\( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Which is:

\( d_1^2 + 2 d_1 d_0 + d_0^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \)

Which can be rewritten as:

\( d_1^2 + (2 d_0 - b) d_1 + (d_0^2 - d_0) = 0 \)

This is quadratic in \( d_1 \). So, for each \( d_0 \), we can solve for \( d_1 \), and see if \( d_1 \) is integer and satisfies \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b - 1 \).

Alternatively, for each \( d_0 \) from 0 to \( b - 1 \), compute \( d_1 \) as:

\( d_1 = \frac{(d_1 + d_0)^2 - d_0}{b - 1} \)

Wait, no, earlier we had:

\( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), where \( s = d_1 + d_0 \)

So, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \)

So, \( d_1 \) must be integer, so \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \)

Given that \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

Therefore, \( s = k (b - 1) \) or \( s = k (b - 1) + 1 \), for some integer \( k \).

Given that \( s \) is between \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and \( b - 1 \), because \( n = s^2 \) must be a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( b \leq s^2 \leq b^2 - 1 \), hence \( \sqrt{b} \leq s < b \).

Therefore, \( s \) is in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

Given that, \( s \) can be expressed as \( k (b - 1) \) or \( k (b - 1) + 1 \), for integer \( k \).

Since \( s < b \), \( k (b - 1) \) must be less than \( b \). So, \( k \leq \lfloor \frac{b}{b - 1} \rfloor = 1 \).

Similarly, \( k (b - 1) + 1 < b \) implies \( k \leq \lfloor \frac{b - 1}{b - 1} \rfloor = 1 \).

Therefore, \( k = 1 \) for both cases.

Thus, \( s = (b - 1) \) or \( s = (b - 1) + 1 = b \).

But \( s \) must be less than \( b \), so \( s = b \) is invalid because \( s < b \). Therefore, \( s = b - 1 \).

Wait, but \( s = b - 1 \), which is the maximum value for \( s \).

But let's verify:

If \( s = b - 1 \), then \( d_1 = \frac{(b - 1)^2 - (b - 1)}{b - 1} = \frac{(b - 1)(b - 2)}{b - 1} = b - 2 \).

So, \( d_1 = b - 2 \), and \( d_0 = s - d_1 = (b - 1) - (b - 2) = 1 \).

So, \( d_0 = 1 \), which is valid as long as \( d_0 \leq b - 1 \), which it is.

Therefore, \( s = b - 1 \) gives a solution with \( d_1 = b - 2 \) and \( d_0 = 1 \).

So, n = s^2 = (b - 1)^2, which is equal to \( d_1 b + d_0 = (b - 2) b + 1 = b^2 - 2b + 1 = (b - 1)^2 \). So, this works.

But is this the only solution?

Wait, no, because earlier, for \( b = 7 \), we had three solutions: 9, 16, 36.

Wait, but according to this, only \( s = b - 1 \) gives a solution.

Wait, so perhaps there are more solutions when \( k \) is not 1.

Wait, but earlier, for \( b = 7 \), \( s = 3, 4, 6 \):

- For s=3: 3^2=9, which is 12 in base 7: 1 + 2=3= sqrt(9).
- For s=4: 4^2=16, which is 22 in base 7: 2 + 2=4= sqrt(16).
- For s=6: 6^2=36, which is 60 in base 7: 6 + 0=6= sqrt(36).

So, each of these s is less than b=7.

Wait, according to our earlier logic, \( s = k (b - 1) \) or \( s = k (b - 1) + 1 \), with \( k \) an integer.

But in the case of \( b=7 \), \( b - 1 = 6 \).

So, \( s = k*6 \) or \( s = k*6 + 1 \).

For \( k=1 \), \( s=6 \) or \( s=7 \). But \( s < 7 \), so \( s=6 \).

But in \( b=7 \), we have \( s=3,4,6 \), which are not multiples of 6.

So, maybe our earlier conclusion is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps \( s \) can also be written as \( k (b - 1) \), where \( k \) is a fraction, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each base \( b \), the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers \( s \) such that \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), with \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) being digits in base \( b \).

Therefore, for each base \( b \), we can count the number of perfect squares \( n = s^2 \) such that \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), and the sum of the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) is equal to \( s \).

So, perhaps the count can be written as:

For each \( b \), count the number of \( s \) such that:
1. \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), i.e., \( b \leq s^2 \leq b^2 - 1 \).
2. The sum of the digits of \( s^2 \) in base \( b \) is equal to \( s \).

So, the count is equal to the number of such \( s \).

So, perhaps for each \( b \), we can find the number of \( s \) in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( \lfloor \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \rfloor \) such that the sum of digits of \( s^2 \) in base \( b \) is equal to \( s \).

But this is still a bit abstract.

Wait, perhaps instead of going base by base, try to find a pattern.

Wait, when \( b = 7 \), we had three numbers: 9, 16, 36.

Similarly, when \( b = 12 \), we had two numbers: 25, 100.

Wait, when \( b = 16 \), we had three numbers: 36, 100, 225.

Wait, 225 is 15^2, written as CD in base 16: 12 + 13 = 25, which is not equal to 15.

Wait, no, 225 is 15^2, but written in base 16 as CD, which is 12 + 13 = 25, which is not 15. Wait, no, in base 16, 225 is 12*16 + 13 = 225, so 12 + 13 = 25, but sqrt(225)=15.

Wait, but 25 ≠ 15, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, n=225 is 15^2, which is 225. When written in base 16, it's CD: 12 and 13, sum is 25. 25 ≠ 15. So, n=225 is not 16-eautiful.

Wait, actually, 225 is 15^2, which is written as 15 in base 10. Wait, no, 225 is 15^2, but in base 16, 225 is CD.

Wait, so perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong.

Wait, so in base 16:

n=36: 36 is 24 in base 16: 2 + 4=6= sqrt(36). So, correct.

n=100: 100 is 64 in base 16: 6 + 4=10= sqrt(100). So, correct.

n=225: 225 is CD in base 16: 12 + 13=25 vs sqrt(225)=15. Not equal.

So, only 36 and 100 are 16-eautiful. So, count is 2.

Wait, so earlier, I thought n=225 was 16-eautiful, but it's not.

So, in that case, for b=16, count is 2.

Wait, so the counts so far are:

b=7: 3

b=12: 2

b=16: 2

Wait, so 3 is the highest.

Wait, maybe try b=23.

Wait, maybe it's better to find a general formula.

Wait, earlier, we saw that when \( s = b - 1 \), \( d_1 = b - 2 \), \( d_0 = 1 \), and \( n = (b - 1)^2 \). So, for each base \( b \geq 3 \), this gives one solution: \( n = (b - 1)^2 \).

But in the case of b=7, we had three solutions, so there are more solutions.

Wait, so perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of \( s(s - 1) \) that are \( b - 1 \).

Wait, from earlier, \( d_1 = \frac{s(s - 1)}{b - 1} \). So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

Therefore, \( s = k (b - 1) \) or \( s = k (b - 1) + 1 \).

Given that \( s < b \), \( k \) can only be 1.

Therefore, \( s = b - 1 \) or \( s = b \). But \( s < b \), so \( s = b - 1 \).

Thus, only one solution for each base \( b \).

Wait, but in the case of b=7, we had three solutions: 9,16,36.

So, my earlier conclusion is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \), but \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, so \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but not necessarily the entire product.

Wait, but if \( b - 1 \) divides \( s \), then \( s = m (b - 1) \). But \( s < b \), so \( m = 1 \), \( s = b - 1 \).

Similarly, if \( b - 1 \) divides \( s - 1 \), then \( s - 1 = m (b - 1) \), so \( s = m (b - 1) + 1 \). Since \( s < b \), \( m = 1 \), so \( s = b - 1 + 1 = b \). But \( s < b \), so \( s = b - 1 \) only.

Wait, that suggests that for each base \( b \), there's only one such \( s \): \( s = b - 1 \), leading to one \( n = (b - 1)^2 \).

But in reality, for \( b=7 \), there are three such numbers: 9, 16, 36.

So, perhaps the issue is that \( b - 1 \) does not necessarily have to divide \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but can divide some multiple.

Wait, but \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, so any common divisor of \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) is 1.

Therefore, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \) only if \( b - 1 \) divides either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

So, for each base \( b \), only one such \( s \) exists, which is \( s = b - 1 \).

But in the case of \( b=7 \), n=9,16,36 are all perfect squares, and their digits in base 7 sum to their square roots.

So, perhaps the initial assumption that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \) is incorrect.

Wait, actually, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \). So, \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \). But since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

Therefore, \( s = k (b - 1) \) or \( s = k (b - 1) + 1 \).

But since \( s < b \), \( k = 1 \).

So, \( s = b - 1 \) or \( s = b \). But \( s < b \), so \( s = b - 1 \).

Therefore, only one solution per base \( b \).

But in reality, for \( b=7 \), we have three solutions.

Wait, maybe the issue is that in addition to \( s = b - 1 \), \( d_0 \) can be zero or one, leading to other solutions.

Wait, for \( b=7 \), n=9 is 12 in base 7: 1 + 2=3, sqrt(9)=3.

So, s=3, which is not \( b - 1 = 6 \). So, how does this happen?

Wait, because \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).

So, for s=3, \( s(s - 1)=3*2=6 \). So, \( b - 1=6 \), which divides 6. So, 6 divides 6, so yes.

Therefore, \( d_1 = 6 / 6 = 1 \), \( d_0 = 3 - 1 = 2 \). So, n=12 in base 7: 1 + 2=3=sqrt(9).

Similarly, for s=4, \( s(s - 1)=4*3=12 \). \( b - 1=6 \) divides 12, so \( d_1=12 / 6=2 \), \( d_0=4 - 2=2 \). So, n=22 in base 7: 2 + 2=4=sqrt(16).

Similarly, for s=6, \( s(s - 1)=6*5=30 \). \( b - 1=6 \) divides 30, so \( d_1=30 / 6=5 \), but \( d_1 \leq b - 1=6 \). So, 5 is valid. Then, \( d_0=6 - 5=1 \). So, n=51 in base 7: 5 + 1=6=sqrt(36).

Wait, so actually, \( s \) can be any integer such that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).

But since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

Therefore, for \( b=7 \), \( b - 1=6 \) divides \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

Therefore, \( s=6k \) or \( s=6k + 1 \).

Since \( s < 7 \), \( k=1 \) gives \( s=6 \) or \( s=7 \), but \( s < 7 \), so \( s=6 \).

But in reality, we had s=3,4,6.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \), but \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, so \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s \) or \( s - 1 \).

But in the case of s=3, \( b - 1=6 \) divides 3*2=6, so yes, 6 divides 6, but 6 does not divide 3 or 2.

Wait, 6 divides 6, but 6 is the product of 3 and 2, which are coprime.

Wait, perhaps \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \), but \( b - 1 \) doesn't necessarily have to divide \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), but can be a factor that includes both.

Wait, for example, in the case of s=3, \( s(s - 1)=6 \), and \( b - 1=6 \), which divides 6.

So, in this case, even though 6 doesn't divide 3 or 2, it divides their product.

Therefore, \( b - 1 \) can divide the product \( s(s - 1) \) even if it doesn't divide \( s \) or \( s - 1 \) individually.

Therefore, the condition is that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \). So, \( s(s - 1) \) must be a multiple of \( b - 1 \).

So, for each base \( b \), the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers \( s \) such that \( s(s - 1) \) is divisible by \( b - 1 \), and \( s \) is in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

Therefore, for each \( b \), we can count the number of \( s \) in that range where \( s(s - 1) \) is divisible by \( b - 1 \).

So, for \( b=7 \), \( b - 1=6 \). So, \( s(s - 1) \) must be divisible by 6. So, \( s \) must be such that \( s \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod 6 \), but also considering that \( s \) is less than 7.

So, s=3: 3*2=6 divisible by 6.

s=4: 4*3=12 divisible by 6.

s=6: 6*5=30 divisible by 6.

So, s=3,4,6. Hence, three solutions.

Similarly, for \( b=12 \), \( b - 1=11 \). So, \( s(s - 1) \) must be divisible by 11.

So, either \( s \equiv 0 \mod 11 \) or \( s \equiv 1 \mod 11 \).

Given that \( s < 12 \), possible s:

s=11: but s must be less than 12, so s=11.

But s=11: \( s(s - 1)=11*10=110 \), which is divisible by 11.

But also, check if s=10: \( s(s - 1)=10*9=90 \), which is divisible by 11? 90 ÷ 11=8.18... No.

s=1: 1*0=0, which is divisible by 11. But s=1 is too low, since \( \lceil \sqrt{12} \rceil = 4 \).

Therefore, s=11 is the only solution.

But in reality, for \( b=12 \), we had n=25 and n=100.

Wait, n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5, sqrt(25)=5.

So, s=5: 5*4=20, which is not divisible by 11. Wait, but 5*4=20, which is not divisible by 11. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the case of \( b=12 \), \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{11} \). So, \( s^2 - s \) must be divisible by 11.

So, \( s(s - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 11 \).

Which implies either \( s \equiv 0 \mod 11 \) or \( s \equiv 1 \mod 11 \).

Given that \( s \) is in \( 4 \leq s < 12 \), the possible \( s \) values:

s=11: but s < 12, so s=11 is allowed.

But 11 is allowed, but also:

s=1: but too low.

Wait, s=11: \( s=11 \), \( d_1 = (121 - 11)/11=110/11=10 \), which is valid, since \( d_1 \leq 11 \). So, \( d_1=10 \), \( d_0=11 - 10=1 \). So, n=10*12 + 1=121, which is three digits. So, invalid.

Wait, so s=11 leads to n=121, which is three digits. So, invalid.

Wait, so no solutions for \( b=12 \).

But earlier, we had n=25 and n=100 as 12-eautiful numbers.

Wait, n=25: 25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5, sqrt(25)=5. So, s=5.

But \( s(s - 1)=5*4=20 \), which is not divisible by 11. So, how does this happen?

Wait, because \( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818, which is not integer. So, that contradicts.

Wait, but n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25). So, it works, but according to our formula, it shouldn't.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, earlier, we set \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), and \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \).

Then, \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \), and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 (b - 1) + s \).

So, \( s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \).

Thus, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

Therefore, for each \( s \), \( d_1 \) must be integer, so \( b - 1 \) divides \( s^2 - s \).

Which is \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).

So, for \( b=12 \), \( b - 1=11 \).

So, \( s(s - 1) \) must be divisible by 11.

So, either \( s \equiv 0 \mod 11 \) or \( s \equiv 1 \mod 11 \).

Given that \( s \) is between \( \sqrt{12} ≈3.464 \) and 11.

So, s=11: but n=121 is three digits.

s=1: too low.

But s=11 is the only one.

But in reality, s=5: n=25 is a solution.

Wait, but 5*4=20, which is not divisible by 11. So, how does this happen?

Wait, because \( d_1 = \frac{25 - 5}{11} = 20 / 11 ≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25).

So, this seems to be a solution outside our formula.

Wait, perhaps our formula is incomplete.

Wait, n=25: 25 in base 12 is 23, which is two digits. So, n=25 is a two-digit number in base 12, which is 23.

So, 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25). So, it works.

But according to our formula, \( d_1 = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

So, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe the problem is that \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), but \( n \) is in decimal. So, n=25 is decimal, which is written as 23 in base 12.

But in our formula, we set \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \) as decimal.

Wait, no, actually, \( n \) is in decimal, but written in base \( b \) as two digits.

So, n is a decimal number, which is equal to \( d_1 b + d_0 \).

But n is also equal to \( s^2 \), and the sum of its base \( b \) digits is \( s \).

So, n=25 is decimal, which is written as 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25).

So, 25=2*12 + 3, which is correct.

But according to our formula:

\( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \), \( d_0=3 \), so:

\( s = d_1 + d_0=2 + 3=5 \).

\( n = d_1 b + d_0=2*12 + 3=25 \).

So, \( s^2=25= n \).

But \( (d_1 + d_0)^2 = s^2 =25 \), but \( d_1 b + d_0=25 \).

So, 25=25.

But according to our formula:

\( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)=(25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \).

Wait, but \( d_1=2 \), so it's different.

Wait, so our formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula is \( d_1 = (n - d_0)/b \).

Given \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

So, \( n = s^2 \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \).

But \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 b + (s - d_1) \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 (b - 1) + s \).

So, \( d_1 (b - 1) = s^2 - s \).

So, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

But in the case of n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_1 = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \), which is integer.

So, this suggests that the formula is correct, but in this case, the formula gives a non-integer, but in reality, \( d_1 \) is integer.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5, sqrt(25)=5.

But according to the formula, \( d_1 = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \), which is integer.

Wait, so our formula is giving a wrong result here.

Wait, perhaps because \( s \) is not related directly to \( d_1 \).

Wait, n=25 is decimal, written as 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25).

So, s=5.

So, \( d_1=2 \), \( d_0=3 \).

So, \( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)=(25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \). But \( d_1=2 \).

So, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps \( s \) is not an integer? No, s=sqrt(n)=5.

Wait, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, because in the formula, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \), but \( s \) is an integer, but \( b - 1 \) may not divide \( s(s - 1) \).

But in this case, \( s(s - 1)=5*4=20 \), and \( b - 1=11 \). 11 does not divide 20.

So, 20 is not divisible by 11, but \( d_1=2 \) is integer.

Wait, so how does this work?

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong that \( d_1 \) must equal \( \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \). Maybe it's not.

Wait, no, because:

From \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \) and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \), and \( n = s^2 \).

So, \( s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \).

But \( d_0 = s - d_1 \).

So, substituting:

\( s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \).

So, \( s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \).

Thus, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

So, in the case of n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_1 = (25 - 5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \), which is integer.

Wait, so that suggests that the formula is not accounting for something.

Wait, but 25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5.

So, s=5, n=25.

But according to the formula, \( d_1=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer. So, in reality, \( d_1=2 \), but according to formula, it's not integer.

So, this suggests that the formula is incomplete or incorrect.

Wait, but in reality, \( d_1=2 \), \( d_0=3 \), \( s=5 \), \( n=25 \).

So, \( s^2 =25=2*12 + 3=25 \).

So, formula gives \( d_1=(25 -5)/11≈1.818 \), but actual \( d_1=2 \).

So, the formula is not matching.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not an integer, but in reality, it's integer.

Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps my formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but in reality, \( d_1=2 \) is integer.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is correct, but my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, in reality, \( d_1=2 \), \( d_0=3 \), so \( s=5 \), \( n=25 \).

But according to the formula:

\( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} = \frac{25 - 5}{11}=20/11≈1.818 \).

But \( d_1=2 \).

So, the formula suggests \( d_1≈1.818 \), but actual \( d_1=2 \).

This suggests that either the formula is wrong, or the problem is more nuanced.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not an integer, so n=25 shouldn't be a solution. But it is.

Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, let's rederive it.

From \( n = s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \), and \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

So, substituting \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) into the first equation:

\( s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \).

So, \( s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \).

So, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

So, formula is correct.

But in the case of n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_1=(25 -5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \). So, non-integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \).

So, this suggests that the formula is correct, but n=25 is not a solution, but it is.

Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, but n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25). So, it is a solution.

So, the formula suggests \( d_1≈1.818 \), but in reality, \( d_1=2 \), which is different.

So, this is a paradox.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, no, formula is derived correctly.

Wait, let me try plugging in the values.

n=25: base 12 digits: 2 and 3.

So, \( d_1=2 \), \( d_0=3 \).

Then, \( s = 2 + 3=5 \).

\( n =2*12 + 3=25=5^2 \).

So, formula says \( d_1=(25 -5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \). But actual \( d_1=2 \).

So, discrepancy.

Wait, but \( d_1=2 \), which is integer, but formula gives non-integer.

Wait, so the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is integer, but formula suggests otherwise.

Wait, maybe the formula is incorrect because \( d_0 \) is not \( s - d_1 \), but \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) is valid only if \( d_0 \) is non-negative.

Wait, but in this case, \( d_0=3 \) is positive.

Wait, so maybe the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but the actual \( d_1=2 \) is integer.

This is a paradox.

Wait, maybe the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but the problem allows \( d_1 \) to be non-integer? No, digits must be integers.

So, this suggests that n=25 is not a solution, but it is.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is integer, but formula is giving a wrong value.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is that \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \) is in decimal, but according to formula, \( d_1 \) is 20/11≈1.818, which is not integer.

But in reality, n=25 is 23 in base 12: 2*12 + 3=25, which is correct.

So, in this case, \( d_1=2 \), which is integer, but formula gives non-integer.

So, this is a contradiction.

Wait, so perhaps the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the substitution.

Wait, from \( n = s^2 = d_1 b + d_0 \).

And \( s = d_1 + d_0 \).

So, substituting \( d_0 = s - d_1 \):

\( s^2 = d_1 b + s - d_1 \).

So, \( s^2 - s = d_1 (b - 1) \).

Thus, \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

So, formula is correct.

But in the case of n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_1=(25 -5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \), which is integer.

So, this suggests that the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but in reality, it is.

This is a paradox.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \) is in decimal, but the formula assumes that \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \).

Wait, but in this case, n=25 is a two-digit number in base 12: 23.

So, n=25 is decimal, which is equal to 23 in base 12: 2*12 + 3=25.

So, formula says \( d_1=20/11≈1.818 \), but \( d_1=2 \).

Wait, 20/11≈1.818 is not equal to 2.

So, this is a problem.

Wait, so maybe the formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not an integer, but in reality, it is.

Wait, but 20/11≈1.818 is not 2.

Wait, so this is a contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, but formula is derived correctly.

Wait, maybe the issue is that \( d_0 = s - d_1 \), but \( d_0 \) must be a digit in base \( b \), so \( d_0 \geq 0 \).

So, in the case of n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_0 = s - d_1=5 - 2=3 \), which is valid.

But according to the formula, \( d_1=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

So, this suggests that the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but in reality, \( d_1=2 \) is integer.

So, this is a paradox.

Therefore, the formula is correct, but in this case, the formula gives a non-integer, but in reality, \( d_1 \) is integer.

So, the formula is correct, but in this case, the formula is not matching reality.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is integer, but \( d_0 \) is also integer, but the formula is not giving the correct \( d_1 \).

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that \( n = s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), but in this case, n=25 is a two-digit number in base 12, but when written in base 12, it's 23, which is two digits.

But according to formula, \( d_1=20/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

So, this is a problem.

Wait, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, which would imply that n=25 is not a solution, but it is.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's compute \( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \).

For n=25, s=5, b=12:

\( d_1=(25 -5)/11=20/11≈1.818 \).

But in reality, \( d_1=2 \).

So, the formula is correct, but n=25 is not a solution.

But in reality, n=25 is a solution because 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25).

So, the formula is correct, but in this case, it's giving a wrong value.

Therefore, perhaps the formula is not applicable here.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong that \( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \).

Wait, no, it's derived correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, which is conflicting with reality.

So, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, but in reality, it is.

So, the formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, \( d_1 \) is not integer, so n=25 is not a solution.

But n=25 is a solution.

Wait, maybe the formula is incorrect because \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( n = d_1 b + d_0 \), but \( n \) is in decimal.

But in the case of n=25, decimal, which is 23 in base 12: 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25).

So, n=25 is a solution.

But formula says \( d_1=(25 -5)/11≈1.818 \), which is not integer.

Therefore, the formula is not giving the correct value.

Wait, maybe the formula is correct, but \( d_1 \) is not an integer, but in reality, it is.

So, in this case, the formula fails.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should instead think of an algorithm:

For each base \( b \), iterate \( s \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

For each \( s \), check if \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \).

If yes, compute \( d_1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \).

If \( d_1 \) is integer and \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \), then \( n = s^2 \) is \( b \)-eautiful.

So, for each base \( b \), the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of such \( s \).

So, for \( b=7 \):

s ranges from 3 to 6.

s=3: \( s^2=9 \). 9 is two-digit in base 7: 12. So, 1 + 2=3=sqrt(9). So, valid.

s=4: \( s^2=16 \). 16 is two-digit in base 7: 22. 2 + 2=4=sqrt(16). Valid.

s=5: \( s^2=25 \). 25 is two-digit in base 7: 35. 3 + 5=8 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal.

s=6: \( s^2=36 \). 36 is two-digit in base 7: 60. 6 + 0=6=sqrt(36). Valid.

So, s=3,4,6: three solutions.

Similarly, for \( b=12 \):

s ranges from 4 to 11.

s=4: \( s^2=16 \). 16 is two-digit in base 12: 14. 1 + 4=5 vs sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

s=5: \( s^2=25 \). 25 is two-digit in base 12:23. 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25). Valid.

s=6: \( s^2=36 \). 36 is two-digit in base 12: 30. 3 + 0=3 vs sqrt(36)=6. Not equal.

s=7: \( s^2=49 \). 49 is two-digit in base 12:41. 4 + 1=5 vs sqrt(49)=7. Not equal.

s=8: \( s^2=64 \). 64 is two-digit in base 12:52. 5 + 2=7 vs sqrt(64)=8. Not equal.

s=9: \( s^2=81 \). 81 is two-digit in base 12:77. 7 + 7=14 vs sqrt(81)=9. Not equal.

s=10: \( s^2=100 \). 100 is two-digit in base 12: 85. 8 + 5=13 vs sqrt(100)=10. Not equal.

s=11: \( s^2=121 \). 121 is three-digit in base 12: 101. So, invalid.

So, only s=5 is valid. So, one solution.

But earlier, I thought n=25 and n=100 were solutions. Wait, n=25: s=5, n=25, which is two-digit in base 12:23. 2 + 3=5=sqrt(25). So, valid.

n=100: 100 is two-digit in base 12:85. 8 + 5=13 vs sqrt(100)=10. Not equal.

So, only n=25 is 12-eautiful. So, count is 1.

Wait, so my earlier conclusion was wrong.

So, for \( b=12 \), only one solution.

Similarly, for \( b=16 \):

s ranges from 4 to 15.

s=4: 16 is two-digit in base 16:10. 1 + 0=1 vs sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.

s=5:25 is two-digit in base 16:19. 1 + 9=10 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal.

s=6:36 is two-digit in base 16:24. 2 + 4=6=sqrt(36). Valid.

s=7:49 is two-digit in base 16:31. 3 + 1=4 vs sqrt(49)=7. Not equal.

s=8:64 is two-digit in base 16:40. 4 + 0=4 vs sqrt(64)=8. Not equal.

s=9:81 is two-digit in base 16:51. 5 + 1=6 vs sqrt(81)=9. Not equal.

s=10:100 is two-digit in base 16:64. 6 + 4=10 vs sqrt(100)=10. Valid.

s=11:121 is three-digit in base 16:79. So, invalid.

s=12:144 is three-digit in base 16:90. So, invalid.

s=13:169 is three-digit in base 16: A9. So, invalid.

s=14:196 is three-digit in base 16: CE. So, invalid.

s=15:225 is three-digit in base 16: CD. So, invalid.

So, only s=6 and s=10 are valid.

So, n=36 and n=100 are 16-eautiful. So, count is 2.

Wait, so for \( b=16 \), count is 2.

So, revising my earlier conclusion.

So, for \( b=7 \): 3

\( b=12 \):1

\( b=16 \):2

So, the maximum count so far is 3.

Wait, let me try \( b=24 \).

Two-digit numbers in base 24: 24 to 575 (10 to FF in base 24).

Perfect squares in this range: 25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196,225,256,289,324,361,400,441,484,529.

Convert each to base 24:

But this is time-consuming. Maybe a smarter approach.

Wait, for each \( s \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{24} \rceil=5 \) to 23.

For each \( s \), check if \( s^2 \) is a two-digit number in base 24, and sum of digits equals \( s \).

So, \( s \) from 5 to 23.

For each \( s \):

- s=5: 25 in base 24 is 11. 1 + 1=2 vs 5. No.
- s=6: 36 in base 24 is 16. 1 + 6=7 vs 6. No.
- s=7: 49 in base 24 is 23. 2 + 3=5 vs 7. No.
- s=8: 64 in base 24 is 2A. 2 + 10=12 vs 8. No.
- s=9: 81 in base 24 is 33. 3 + 3=6 vs 9. No.
- s=10: 100 in base 24 is 41. 4 + 1=5 vs 10. No.
- s=11: 121 in base 24 is 4D. 4 + 13=17 vs 11. No.
- s=12: 144 in base 24 is 60. 6 + 0=6 vs 12. No.
- s=13: 169 in base 24 is 6D. 6 + 13=19 vs 13. No.
- s=14: 196 in base 24 is 7E. 7 + 14=21 vs 14. No.
- s=15: 225 in base 24 is 8F. 8 + 15=23 vs 15. No.
- s=16: 256 in base 24 is 100. Three digits. Invalid.
- s=17: 289 in base 24 is 11D. 1 + 13=14 vs 17. No.
- s=18: 324 in base 24 is 13C. 1 + 12=13 vs 18. No.
- s=19: 361 in base 24 is 19. Wait, 19^2=361. 361 in base 24 is 19 (1*24 + 19). 1 + 19=20 vs 19. No.
- s=20: 400 in base 24 is 16. 1 + 6=7 vs 20. No.
- s=21: 441 in base 24 is 1D. 1 + 13=14 vs 21. No.
- s=22: 484 in base 24 is 1E. 1 + 14=15 vs 22. No.
- s=23: 529 in base 24 is 21. 2 + 1=3 vs 23. No.

So, none of these s satisfy the condition.

Thus, count is 0.

Wait, so for \( b=24 \), count is 0.

Wait, seems like the count is not increasing as b increases.

Wait, perhaps try \( b=25 \).

s from 5 to 24.

For each s:

- s=5:25=11 in base25:1+1=2 vs5.No
- s=6:36=16 in base25:1+6=7 vs6.No
- s=7:49=1C in base25:1+12=13 vs7.No
- s=8:64=24+16=40 in base25:4+0=4 vs8.No
- s
