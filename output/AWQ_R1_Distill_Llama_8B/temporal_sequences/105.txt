Alright, let's try to figure out when Mark could have gone to the coffee shop. I'll start by laying out all the information given and see how the times overlap.

First, Mark wakes up at 7am. Richard sees him working out at the gym from 7am to 9am. So, from 7am to 9am, Mark is at the gym. That means he can't be at the coffee shop during this time.

Next, Jennifer sees Mark walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 9am to 12pm. So, from 9am to 12pm, he's heading to the Statue of Liberty. He's not at the coffee shop during this period either.

Mary sees Mark working at the office from 12pm to 1pm. So, between 12pm and 1pm, he's at the office. Again, that rules out the coffee shop during this time.

Betty sees Mark playing tennis at the tennis court from 1pm to 3pm. So, between 1pm and 3pm, he's occupied with tennis. No coffee shop visit here.

Ashley sees Mark reading at the library from 6pm to 7pm. So, from 6pm to 7pm, he's at the library. That means the coffee shop is still closed after 7pm, as mentioned.

Now, let's look at the coffee shop's operating hours. It was closed after 7pm. So, the latest Mark could have gone is before 7pm.

Looking at the times when Mark is free:

- 9am to 12pm: At the Statue of Liberty
- 12pm to 1pm: At the office
- 1pm to 3pm: Playing tennis
- 6pm to 7pm: At the library

The only times not accounted for are between 7am and 9am (but he's at the gym), between 3pm and 6pm, and between 7pm and... well, the coffee shop closes after 7pm, so he can't go after that.

So, the only available window when he could have gone to the coffee shop is between 3pm and 6pm.

Let me double-check:

- 7am to 9am: Gym
- 9am to 12pm: Statue of Liberty
- 12pm to 1pm: Office
- 1pm to 3pm: Tennis
- 3pm to 6pm: Free time
- 6pm to 7pm: Library
- After 7pm: Coffee shop is closed

Yes, the only time he's free is between 3pm and 6pm.
