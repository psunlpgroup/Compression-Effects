Alright, let's try to figure out between what times Ashley could have gone to the football field. So, Ashley's day starts at 1pm when she wakes up. Then, there are several people who saw Ashley doing different activities at specific times.

First, Lisa saw Ashley taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 2pm to 5pm. Okay, so from 2pm to 5pm, Ashley was taking photos. That means she wasn't at the football field during that time.

Next, Nancy saw Ashley working out at the gym from 5pm to 6pm. So, from 5pm to 6pm, Ashley was at the gym. That means she wasn't at the football field during that window either.

Then, Steven saw Ashley working at the office from 6pm to 9pm. So, from 6pm to 9pm, Ashley was at the office. She wasn't at the football field during that time.

Finally, Kimberly saw Ashley buying a bike at the bike shop from 9pm to 10pm. So, from 9pm to 10pm, Ashley was buying a bike. The football field was closed after 10pm, so she couldn't have gone there after 10pm.

Putting all this together, we need to find a time when Ashley wasn't doing any of those activities. Let's list out the times when Ashley was occupied:

- 2pm to 5pm: Taking photos
- 5pm to 6pm: Working out
- 6pm to 9pm: Working at the office
- 9pm to 10pm: Buying a bike

So, we need to find a time between these intervals when Ashley could have gone to the football field.

Looking at the times:

- From 1pm to 2pm: Ashley just woke up. There's no information that she was doing anything specific during this time. So, it's possible she went to the football field then.

- Between 5pm to 6pm: She was at the gym, so no.

- Between 6pm to 9pm: She was at the office, so no.

- After 10pm: The football field was closed, so she couldn't have gone then.

Therefore, the only possible time is between 1pm and 2pm when Ashley wasn't doing anything specific.

So, the answer should be (A) 1pm to 2pm.

The correct answer is (A) 1pm to 2pm.

Step-by-step explanation:
Ashley woke up at 1pm. Between 2pm and 5pm, she was taking photos. Then from 5pm to 6pm, she was at the gym, from 6pm to 9pm at the office, and from 9pm to 10pm buying a bike. The football field was closed after 10pm, so the only available time for Ashley to visit the football field is between 1pm and 2pm.

Answer: (A) 1pm to 2pm
