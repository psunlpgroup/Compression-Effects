Alright, let's try to figure out whether James has a part-time job offered by the university. I'll start by breaking down the given premises and see how they connect.

First, the premise says that none of the students currently working in the library are from the computer science department. So, if someone is working in the library, they're not in CS. That's interesting because it sets a contrast between library workers and CS students.

Next, it mentions that all students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. So, every student who has a university part-time job is working in the library. That means if someone isn't working in the library, they don't have that particular part-time job. But wait, James isn't working in the library, as stated in the conclusion. So, if he's not in the library, he doesn't have the university part-time job. But wait, the conclusion says he doesn't have a part-time job, but the question is whether he has one offered by the university. So, maybe he has a different part-time job not offered by the university?

Moving on, all students taking the database course are from the computer science department. So, if someone is in the database course, they are in CS. Now, it's also stated that all students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. So, Professor David's class is the database course, and anyone in that class is in CS. 

Then, all students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David. So, if you're in the lab, you're in his class, which is the database course, making you a CS student. 

James is a student working in the lab, so according to the last statement, James is taking Professor David's class, which is the database course, so he's in CS. 

But earlier, it was said that none of the library workers are from CS. So, James isn't a library worker and is in CS. 

Now, the second premise says all students with university part-time jobs are in the library. Since James isn't in the library, he doesn't have that particular part-time job. But the conclusion is about whether he has a part-time job offered by the university. 

Wait, the second premise only mentions that all students with part-time jobs offered by the university are in the library. It doesn't say anything about all students in the library having such jobs. So, the library could have students with other part-time jobs not offered by the university, or maybe they have the university jobs but also others. 

But since James isn't in the library, he doesn't have the university part-time job. However, the conclusion says James doesn't have a part-time job at all, not just not the university one. So, maybe he has a part-time job elsewhere, but not the university's. 

But the question is specifically about whether James has a part-time job offered by the university. Since the second premise only connects university part-time jobs to library workers, and James isn't a library worker, he doesn't have that specific part-time job. 

So, putting it all together: James is in the lab, taking Professor David's class, so he's in the database course, making him a CS student. Since he's not in the library, he doesn't have a university part-time job. Therefore, the conclusion that James has a part-time job offered by the university is false.

Conclusion: False.
