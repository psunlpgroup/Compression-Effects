Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about Susan and John flying to or from LGA airport, and we need to determine if John flies to LGA based on the given premises.

First, the premise says Susan flies to LGA airport. That means Susan is arriving at LGA, right? So Susan is landing there, not taking off from it. Then, it says the departure and arrival can't be at the same airport. Hmm, so Susan can't be both departing and arriving at the same place. Since she's arriving at LGA, her departure must be from a different airport.

Next, John flies from LGA airport. Wait, so John is taking off from LGA. But Susan is arriving there. Since departure and arrival can't be at the same airport, that means Susan isn't departing from LGA; she's arriving there, and John is leaving from LGA. So, Susan is landing at LGA, and John is taking off from LGA. So, their departure and arrival points are different because Susan is arriving and John is departing.

Now, the conclusion is that John flies to LGA airport. Wait, does that mean he's arriving there? Or is he departing? The premise says John flies from LGA, which would mean he's departing. But the conclusion says he flies to LGA, which would mean he's arriving. That seems contradictory. So, if John is flying from LGA, he can't be flying to LGA at the same time unless he's making a round trip or something. But the problem doesn't mention that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down step by step.

1. Susan flies to LGA: So Susan arrives at LGA.
2. Departure and arrival can't be at the same airport: So Susan isn't departing from LGA, she's arriving there.
3. John flies from LGA: So John departs from LGA.

So, Susan is arriving at LGA, and John is departing from LGA. Therefore, their flights are from different airports (John from LGA, Susan to LGA). So, their departure and arrival points are different, which aligns with the premise that they can't be at the same airport.

But the conclusion is that John flies to LGA. If he's flying from LGA, he's departing, not arriving. So the conclusion seems to contradict the premise because if he's departing from LGA, he can't be arriving there unless he's returning, which isn't stated.

Wait, maybe the conclusion is that John flies to LGA, meaning he arrives there. But he's already departing from LGA. That would mean he's flying from LGA to LGA, which is a possibility, but the premise doesn't specify whether he's arriving or departing.

Wait, no, the premise says John flies from LGA, which is departure. So the conclusion says he flies to LGA, which is arrival. So logically, if he's departing from LGA, he's going somewhere else, not arriving at LGA unless it's a return trip. But the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the conclusion is incorrect because John is departing, not arriving.

Wait, but the conclusion is just stating that John flies to LGA, not necessarily that he's arriving there. Maybe it's just a conclusion based on the fact that he's flying from LGA, but that doesn't make sense because flying to LGA would mean arriving, not departing.

So, the premise says Susan arrives at LGA, and John departs from LGA. Since they can't be at the same airport, that's fine because Susan is arriving and John is departing. But the conclusion says John flies to LGA, which would mean he's arriving there. But he's actually departing from there, so the conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the conclusion. Maybe it's just stating that John flies to LGA, regardless of direction. But logically, if he's flying from LGA, he can't be flying to LGA unless he's making a round trip, which isn't specified. So the conclusion is uncertain because we don't know if John is flying to LGA or from LGA.

Wait, no, the premise clearly states John flies from LGA, so he's departing. So the conclusion that he flies to LGA would mean he's arriving, which contradicts the premise. Therefore, the conclusion is false because John is departing from LGA, not arriving there.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is just stating that John flies to LGA, meaning he's flying to that airport, regardless of direction. But since he's already departing from there, it's a bit confusing. Maybe the conclusion is that John flies to LGA, which would mean he's arriving there, but since he's departing, that's not possible unless he's returning. But the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps the conclusion is that John flies to LGA, but since he's already flying from LGA, that's not possible unless he's making a round trip. Since we don't have that information, the conclusion is uncertain.

Wait, no, the premise clearly says John flies from LGA, so he's leaving LGA. Therefore, the conclusion that he flies to LGA would mean he's arriving there, which is a contradiction. So the conclusion is false because John is departing from LGA, not arriving there.

Wait, but the conclusion is that John flies to LGA, which would be arriving, but he's already departing. So the conclusion is incorrect because he can't be both departing and arriving at the same airport, which is against the premise. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

Wait, no, the premise says departure and arrival can't be at the same airport. So Susan is arriving at LGA, and John is departing from LGA, which is fine because they're not at the same airport for both. So the conclusion that John flies to LGA would mean he's arriving there, but he's actually departing, so the conclusion is false because he's not arriving there.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is just stating that John flies to LGA, which could be a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe it's supposed to be that John flies from LGA, but the conclusion says he flies to LGA, which is incorrect.

So, to sum up, Susan arrives at LGA, John departs from LGA. The conclusion is that John flies to LGA, which would mean he's arriving there, but he's actually departing. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
</think>

The conclusion that John flies to LGA airport is **false**. 

**Explanation:**
- Susan arrives at LGA, so her departure is from another airport.
- John departs from LGA, meaning he is flying away from it.
- The premise states that departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport, which is satisfied since Susan arrives and John departs from LGA.
- However, the conclusion incorrectly states that John flies to LGA, implying he arrives there, which contradicts the premise that he departs from LGA.
- Therefore, the conclusion is false because John is departing from LGA, not arriving there.

**Answer:** The conclusion is false.
