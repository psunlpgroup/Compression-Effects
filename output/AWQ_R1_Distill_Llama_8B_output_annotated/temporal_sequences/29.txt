["initializing"] Alright, let's figure out the possible times Hannah could have gone to the beach. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, Hannah woke up at 5am. So her day starts at 5am. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Richard saw her on the rooftop from 5am to 7am. That means from 5am to 7am, she was on the rooftop. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Ashley saw her getting coffee from 9am to 7pm. So from 9am to 7pm, she was at the cafe. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Jennifer saw her taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7pm to 8pm. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] The beach was closed after 8pm, so she couldn't have gone to the beach after 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Looking at the times: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - **5am to 7am**: She was on the rooftop, so she wasn't at the beach. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - **7am to 9am**: There's a gap between 7am and 9am where we don't have any information. Maybe she went to the beach during this time. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - **9am to 7pm**: She was at the cafe, so she wasn't at the beach. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - **7pm to 8pm**: She was taking photos, so she wasn't at the beach. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Since the beach was closed after 8pm, she couldn't have gone after 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So the only possible time she could have gone to the beach is between **7am and 9am**. ["end-section"]

["uncertainty-estimation"] Let me double-check: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - From 5am to 7am: Rooftop. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - 7am to 9am: Possible beach time. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - 9am to 7pm: Cafe. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] - 7pm to 8pm: Photos. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Beach is closed after 8pm, so no later than 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Therefore, the only available window is **7am to 9am**. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] The options are: ["end-section"]

["deduction"] (A) 7pm to 8pm ["end-section"]

["deduction"] (B) 7am to 9am ["end-section"]

["deduction"] (C) 9am to 7pm ["end-section"]

["deduction"] (D) 5am to 7am ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So the correct answer is **(B)**. ["end-section"]
