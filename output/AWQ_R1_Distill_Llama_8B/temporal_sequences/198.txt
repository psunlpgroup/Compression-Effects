To determine the possible times Elizabeth could have gone to the movies, let's analyze the timeline provided by the various people's observations.

1. **Elizabeth's wake-up time**: She wakes up at 5am.

2. **Sarah's observation**: She saw Elizabeth getting coffee from 5am to 3pm.

3. **Susan's observation**: She saw Elizabeth working out at the gym from 3pm to 4pm.

7. **Movies closing time**: The movies were closed after 9pm.

**Step-by-step analysis**:
- From 5am to 3pm: Elizabeth was getting coffee.
- From 3pm to 4pm: She was working out at the gym.
- From 4pm to 6pm: She was buying a phone.
- From 6pm to 7pm: She was waiting at the train station.
- From 7pm to 8pm: She was waiting at the airport.
