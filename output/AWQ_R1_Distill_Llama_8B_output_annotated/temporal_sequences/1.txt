["initializing"] Alright, let's try to figure out when Emily could have gone to the soccer field. ["end-section"]

["initializing"] So, we have several clues about where Emily was at different times and when the soccer field was available. Let's lay it out step by step. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] First, Emily woke up at 10am. That's our starting point. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, Linda saw Emily waiting at the train station from 10am to 12pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, Linda saw Emily from 10am until noon. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Next, Ashley saw Emily fixing their computer at the electronic store from 12pm to 1pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, after Linda saw her at noon, Ashley saw her an hour later, until 1pm. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Then, John saw Emily walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 1pm to 2pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, after Ashley saw her at 1pm, John saw her an hour later, until 2pm. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] Finally, the soccer field was closed after 8pm. So, the soccer field was open until 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, we need to figure out the possible times when Emily could have gone to the soccer field, based on when she wasn't seen by Linda, Ashley, or John. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Let's list out the times when Emily was seen: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - 10am to 12pm: Train station (Linda) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - 12pm to 1pm: Electronic store (Ashley) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - 1pm to 2pm: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty (John) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, from this, Emily was occupied from 10am until 2pm. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But the soccer field was closed after 8pm, so the soccer field was available from when? Well, the field was closed after 8pm, which suggests it was open before 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the soccer field was available until 8pm. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Now, we need to find a time when Emily wasn't seen by Linda, Ashley, or John, and when the soccer field was open. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] Looking at the timeline: ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - From 10am to 12pm: At the train station (Linda saw her) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - 12pm to 1pm: At the electronic store (Ashley saw her) ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] - 1pm to 2pm: Walking towards the Statue of Liberty (John saw her) ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the only time when Emily wasn't seen by anyone is after 2pm. ["end-section"]

["adding-knowledge"] But the soccer field was closed after 8pm, ["end-section"]

["deduction"] so it was open until 8pm. Therefore, Emily could have gone to the soccer field between 2pm and 8pm. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] Let's check the options: (A) 12pm to 1pm – But Ashley saw her during this time, so that's not possible. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (B) 10am to 12pm – Linda saw her during this time, so that's not possible. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (C) 2pm to 8pm – This fits because the soccer field was open until 8pm, and no one saw her after 2pm. ["end-section"]

["example-testing"] (D) 1pm to 2pm – John saw her during this time, so that's not possible. ["end-section"]

["deduction"] So, the correct answer is (C) 2pm to 8pm. ["end-section"]
